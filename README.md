**Reality** is your quick access point to almost any entity existing in
real world (and described in Wikipedia). Its goal is to make the world
inspectable and computable.

**!!!IMPORTANT!!!** This is **pre-release** of new, completely rewritten version. Previos version
turned to be a (nice-looking) dead end. It still can be found at [old-prototype](https://github.com/molybdenum-99/reality/tree/old-prototype-branch)
branch, and installed as a gem version 0.0.5.

Current state is very WIP and prerelease is made for people to play at [RubyConf India 2018](http://rubyconfindia.org/)

[See the presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I4mznHUBhVVDxWfO2DRzxP4wNhs9Mmtx09SizLqIbaE/edit?usp=sharing).

Stay tuned for large and important updates!
