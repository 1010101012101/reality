        hill was known to them as ''''Buen Ayre'''' (or \"Bonaria\" in [[Sardinian

        in the old city (the castle area), which is adjacent to [[swampland]]. During
        the siege of Cagliari, the Aragonese built a [[Shrine of Our Lady of Bonaria|sanctuary]]

        in 1516. His expedition was cut short when he was killed during an attack
        by the native [[Charrua|Charr\u00faa]] tribe in what is now [[Uruguay]].\n\nThe
        city of Buenos Aires was first established as ''''Ciudad de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora
        Santa Mar\u00eda del Buen Ayre''''<ref name=\"Short history\"/> (literally

        1536 by a Spanish expedition led by [[Pedro de Mendoza]]. The settlement founded
        by Mendoza was located in what is today the [[San Telmo]] district of Buenos
        Aires, south of the city center.\n\nMore attacks by the indigenous people
        forced the settlers away, and in 1542 the site was abandoned.<ref>[http://www.laeducacion.com/vinculos/materias/historia/not020107.htm

        permanent) settlement was established in 1580 by [[Juan de Garay]], who arrived
        by sailing down the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] from [[Asunci\u00f3n]] (now the
        capital of Paraguay). He dubbed the settlement \"Sant\u00edsima Trinidad\"
        and its port became \"Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda de los Buenos Aires.\"<ref
        name=\"provincia\"/>\n\nFrom its earliest days, Buenos Aires depended primarily
        on trade. During most of the 17th and 18th centuries, Spanish ships were menaced
        by pirates, so they developed a complex system where ships with military protection
        were dispatched to Central America, cross the land, from there to [[Lima|Lima,
        Peru]] and from it to the [[inner city|inner cities]] of the viceroyalty.
        Because of this, products took a very long time to arrive in Buenos Aires,
        and the taxes generated by the transport made them prohibitive. This scheme
        frustrated the traders of Buenos Aires, and a thriving contraband industry
        developed. This also instilled a deep resentment in ''''[[porte\u00f1o]]s''''
        towards the Spanish authorities.<ref name=\"Short history\"/>\n\nSensing these
        feelings, [[Charles III of Spain]] progressively eased the trade restrictions
        and finally declared Buenos Aires an open port in the late 18th century. The
        capture of [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Porto Bello]] by British forces also fueled
        the need to foster commerce via the Atlantic route, to the detriment of Lima-based
        trade. One of his rulings was to split a region from the Viceroyalty of Per\u00fa
        and create instead the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], with Buenos
        Aires as the capital. However, Charles''s placating actions did not have the
        desired effect, and the ''''porte\u00f1os'''', some of them versed in the
        ideology of the [[French Revolution]], became even more convinced of the need
        for independence from Spain.\n\n===War of independence===\n{{see also|Argentine

        Rosada]] in a painting of 1910, this view of the back (now Parque Col\u00f3n).]]\n\nDuring
        the [[British invasions of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], British forces attacked
        Buenos Aires twice. In 1806 the British successfully invaded Buenos Aires,
        but an army from [[Montevideo]] led by [[Santiago de Liniers]] defeated them.
        In the brief period of British rule, the viceroy [[Rafael Sobremonte]] managed
        to escape to [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and designated this
        city as capital. Buenos Aires became the capital again after its liberation,
        but Sobremonte could not resume his duties as viceroy. Santiago de Liniers,
        chosen as new viceroy, prepared the city against a possible new British attack
        and repelled the attempted invasion of 1807. The militarization generated
        in society changed the balance of power favorably for the [[criollo people|criollo]]s
        (in contrast to [[peninsulars]]), as well as the development of the [[Peninsular
        War]] in Spain. An attempt by the peninsular merchant [[Mart\u00edn de \u00c1lzaga]]
        to remove Liniers and replace him with a [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Junta]]
        was defeated by the criollo armies. However, by 1810 it would be those same
        armies who would support a new revolutionary attempt, successfully removing
        the new viceroy [[Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros]]. This is known as the [[May
        Revolution]], which is now celebrated as a national holiday. This event started
        the [[Argentine War of Independence]], and many armies left Buenos Aires to
        fight the diverse strongholds of royalist resistance, with varying levels
        of success. The government was held first by two Juntas of many members, then
        by two [[triumvirate]]s, and finally by a unipersonal office, the [[Supreme
        Director of the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Supreme Director]].
        Formal independence from Spain was [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declared]]
        in 1816, at the [[Congress of Tucum\u00e1n]]. Buenos Aires managed to endure
        the whole [[Spanish American wars of independence]] without falling again
        under royalist rule.\n\n[[File:Horacio Coppola - Buenos Aires 1936 - Corrientes
        desde el edificio COMEGA nocturna.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Avenida 9 de Julio]],
        1936.|alt=]]\n\nHistorically, Buenos Aires has been Argentina''s main venue
        for [[liberalism|liberal]], [[free-trade]] and foreign ideas, while many of
        the provinces, especially to the north-west, advocated a more [[nationalism|nationalistic]]
        and [[Catholic]] approach to political and social issues. Much of the internal
        tension in Argentina''s history, starting with the centralist-federalist conflicts
        of the 19th century, can be traced back to these contrasting views. In the
        months immediately following 25 May Revolution, Buenos Aires sent a number
        of military envoys to the provinces with the intention of obtaining their
        approval. Many of these missions ended in violent clashes, and the enterprise
        fuelled tensions between the capital and the provinces.\n\nIn the 19th century
        the city was [[blockade]]d twice by naval forces: by the [[French blockade
        of the R\u00edo de la Plata|French]] from 1838 to 1840, and later by an [[Anglo-French
        blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Anglo-French]] expedition from 1845 to
        1848. Both blockades failed to force the city into submission, and the foreign
        powers eventually desisted from their demands.\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:L\u00ednea

        Aires, street and aerial images. Archival footage.]]\n\nDuring most of the
        19th century, the political status of the city remained a sensitive subject.
        It was already capital of [[Buenos Aires Province]], and between 1853 and
        1860 it was the capital of the seceded [[State of Buenos Aires]]. The issue
        was fought out more than once on the battlefield, until the matter was finally
        settled in 1880 when the city was [[Federalization of Buenos Aires|federalized]]
        and became the seat of government, with its mayor appointed by the president.
        The [[Casa Rosada]] became the seat of the [[President of Argentina|president]].<ref
        name=\"provincia\"/>\n\nHealth conditions in poor areas were negative, with
        high rates of tuberculosis.  Public-health physicians and politicians typically
        blamed both the poor themselves and their ramshackle tenement houses (conventillos)
        for the spread of the dreaded disease.  People ignored public-health campaigns
        to limit the spread of contagious diseases, such as the prohibition of spitting
        on the streets, the strict guidelines to care for infants and young children,
        and quarantines that separated families from ill loved ones.<ref>Diego Armus,
        ''''The Ailing City: Health, Tuberculosis, and Culture in Buenos Aires, 1870\u20131950''''
        (2011)</ref>\n\nIn addition to the wealth generated by the [[Buenos Aires
        Customs]] and the fertile [[pampas]], [[Rail transport in Argentina|railroad
        development]] in the second half of the 19th century increased the economic
        power of Buenos Aires as raw materials flowed into its factories. A leading
        destination for immigrants from Europe, particularly Italy and Spain, from
        1880 to 1930 Buenos Aires became a multicultural city that ranked itself with
        the major European capitals. The [[Teatro Col\u00f3n|Col\u00f3n Theater]]
        became one of the world''s top opera venues, and the city became the regional
        capital of [[Radio in Argentina|radio]], [[Television in Argentina|television]],
        [[Argentine cinema|cinema]], and [[Culture of Argentina#Theatre|theatre]].
        The city''s main avenues were built during those years, and the dawn of the
        20th century saw the construction of South America''s then-tallest buildings
        and the first [[Buenos Aires Underground|underground]] system. A second construction
        boom from 1945 to 1980 reshaped downtown and much of the city.\n\nBuenos Aires
        also attracted migrants from Argentina''s provinces and neighboring countries.
        [[Shanty town]]s (''''[[villa miseria|villas miseria]]'''') started growing
        around the city''s industrial areas during the 1930s, leading to pervasive
        social problems and social contrasts with the largely upwardly mobile Buenos
        Aires population. These laborers became the political base of [[Peronism]],
        which emerged in Buenos Aires during the [[Loyalty Day (Argentina)|pivotal
        demonstration]] of 17 October 1945, at the [[Plaza de Mayo]].<ref name=\"Clar\u00edn

        workers of the Greater Buenos Aires industrial belt have been Peronism''s
        main support base ever since, and Plaza de Mayo became the site for demonstrations
        and many of the country''s political events; on 16 June 1955, however, a splinter
        faction of the Navy bombed the Plaza de Mayo area, killing 364 civilians (see
        ''''[[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo]]''''). This was the only time the city was
        attacked from the air, and the event was followed by a military uprising which
        deposed President Per\u00f3n, three months later (see ''''[[Revoluci\u00f3n
        Libertadora]]'''').\n[[File:Argentinien Buenos Aires Nacht Puerto Madero.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Puerto
        Madero]] at night.]]\n\nIn the 1970s the city suffered from the fighting between
        left-wing revolutionary movements ([[Montoneros]], [[People''s Revolutionary
        Army (Argentina)|E.R.P.]] and F.A.R.) and the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]]
        paramilitary group [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Triple A]], supported
        by [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n|Isabel Per\u00f3n]], who became president
        of Argentina in 1974 after Juan Per\u00f3n''s death.\n\nThe [[March 1976 coup]],
        led by General [[Jorge Videla]], only escalated this conflict; the \"[[Dirty
        War]]\" resulted in 30,000 ''''[[Forced disappearance|desaparecidos]]''''
        (people kidnapped and killed by the military during the years of the junta).<ref

        appointed mayor, [[Osvaldo Cacciatore]], also drew up plans for a network
        of freeways intended to relieve the city''s acute traffic gridlock. The plan,
        however, called for a seemingly indiscriminate razing of residential areas
        and, though only three of the eight planned were put up at the time, they
        were mostly obtrusive raised freeways that continue to blight a number of
        formerly comfortable neighborhoods to this day.\n\nThe city was visited by
        [[Pope John Paul II]] twice: in 1982, and a second visit in 1987, which gathered
        some of the largest crowds in the city''s history. The return of democracy
        in 1983 coincided with a cultural revival, and the 1990s saw an economic revival,
        particularly in the construction and financial sectors.\n\nOn 17 March 1992
        a bomb [[1992 Israeli Embassy attack in Buenos Aires|exploded in the Israeli
        Embassy]], killing 29 and injuring 242. Another explosion, on 18 July 1994

        killing 85 and injuring many more, these incidents marked the beginning of
        [[Middle East]]ern [[terrorism]] to South America.\n\nFollowing a [[Pact of
        Olivos|1993 agreement]], the [[Constitution of Argentina|Argentine Constitution]]
        was amended to give Buenos Aires [[autonomy]] and rescinding, among other
        things, the president''s right to appoint the city''s mayor (as had been the
        case since 1880). On 30 June 1996, voters in Buenos Aires chose their first

        as the distribution hub for a vast area of the south-eastern region of the

        purchasing power and a large local supply of skilled labor as it does from
        its relationship to massive agriculture and industry just outside the city
        limits. Construction activity in Buenos Aires has historically been among
        the most accurate indicators of national economic fortunes (''''see table
        at right''''), and since 2006 around 3 million m\u00b2 (32&nbsp;million ft\u00b2)
        of construction has been authorized annually.<ref name=city/> Meat, dairy,
        grain, tobacco, wool and leather products are processed or manufactured in
        the [[Greater Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires metro area]]. Other leading industries
        are automobile manufacturing, oil refining, metalworking, machine building
        and the production of textiles, chemicals, clothing and beverages.\n\n===Government
        finances===\nThe city''s budget, per Mayor Macri''s 2011 proposal, will include
        US$6&nbsp;billion in revenues and US$6.3&nbsp;billion in expenditures. The
        city relies on local income and capital gains taxes for 61% of its revenues,
        while federal revenue sharing will contribute 11%, [[property tax]]es, 9%,
        and vehicle taxes, 6%. Other revenues include user fees, fines and gambling
        duties. The city devotes 26% of its budget to education, 22% for health, 17%
        for [[public service]]s and infrastructure, 16% for social welfare and culture,
        12% in administrative costs and 4% for law enforcement. Buenos Aires maintains
        low debt levels and its service requires less than 3% of the budget.<ref>{{cite

        (as that of other cities like [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] and [[Montevideo]],
        Uruguay) is characterised by ''''[[voseo]]'''', ''''[[ye\u00edsmo]]'''' and
        aspiration of ''''s'''' in various contexts. It is heavily influenced by the
        dialects of Spanish spoken in [[Andalusia]] and [[Murcia]]. A phonetic study
        conducted by the Laboratory for Sensory Investigations of [[National Scientific
        and Technical Research Council|CONICET]] and the [[University of Toronto]]
        showed that the [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of ''''[[porte\u00f1o]]''''

        Argentina absorbed millions of immigrants, many of them Italians, who spoke
        mostly in their local dialects (mainly Neapolitan, [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]
        and [[Genoese language|Genoese]]). Their adoption of Spanish was gradual,
        creating a [[pidgin]] of Italian dialects and Spanish that was called ''''[[cocoliche]]''''.
        Its usage declined around the 1950s.\n\nMany Spanish immigrants were from
        [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and Spaniards are still generically referred
        to in Argentina as ''''gallegos'''' ([[Galician people|Galicians]]). [[Galician
        language]], cuisine and culture had a major presence in the city for most
        of the 20th century. In recent years, descendants of Galician immigrants have
        led a mini-boom in [[Celtic music]] (which also highlighted the [[Y Wladfa|Welsh
        traditions of Patagonia]]).\n\n[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] was commonly heard
        in Buenos Aires, especially in the [[Balvanera]] garment district and in [[Villa
        Crespo]] until the 1960s. Most of the newer immigrants learn Spanish quickly
        and assimilate into city life.\n\nThe ''''[[Lunfardo]]'''' [[argot]] originated
        within the prison population, and in time spread to all ''''porte\u00f1os''''.
        Lunfardo uses words from Italian dialects, from [[Brazilian Portuguese]],
        from African and Caribbean languages and even from English. Lunfardo employs
        humorous tricks such as inverting the syllables within a word ([[vesre]]).
        Today, Lunfardo is mostly heard in tango lyrics;<ref>[http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~tango/Articles/2001_Economist.pdf

        as respectable until adopted by the Parisian high society in the 1920s, and
        then all over the world. In Buenos Aires, tango-dancing schools (known as
        ''''academias'''') were usually men-only establishments.\n\nOn 30 September
        2009, UNESCO''s Intergovernmental Committee of Intangible Heritage declared

        Aires Philharmonic]] is an Argentine orchestra based in Buenos Aires. Founded
        in 1946, it is based in the renowned [[Teatro Col\u00f3n|Col\u00f3n Theatre]],
        and is considered one of the more prestigious orchestras in its nation and
        Latin America, and has received several honours in 60 years of history. Its
        local counterpart in the national aegis is the [[Argentine National Symphony
        Orchestra]]. The orchestra''s  Music Director is Mexican [[Enrique Diemecke]].\n\nThe
        Buenos Aires Philharmonic has had three successful tours of special relevance:
        in 1992, 1994 and 1996. These tours have included stops in Germany, England,
        Spain, France, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium and Austria, and has
        performed in such prestigious venues as the [[Berliner Philharmonie]], the
        [[Barbican Centre]] in London (one of the most famous cultural centers in
        Europe, also home to the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]), and the [[Concertgebouw]]
        of [[Amsterdam]] (home to the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] of Amsterdam).
        The orchestra frequently tours nationally and in the surrounding countries
        of [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], and [[Uruguay]].\n\nPhilharmonic associations had,
        by then, a long tradition in Argentina, and could be traced in Buenos Aires
        to the 1822 formation of the Academy of Music and of the Philharmonic Association,
        the following year. These orchestras struggled under the instability prevailing
        during the years of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Argentina|Argentine Confederation]],
        however, and their performances were only sporadic. The [[German Argentine]]
        community helped advance the medium with the founding a number of [[choir|choral
        societies]] between 1852 and 1863, notably ''''Concordia'''', ''''Germania''''
        and the ''''Deutsche Sing-Akademie'''', and these were complementted by the
        Buenos Aires Orchestral Society (1876) and the Musical Mutual Society (1894).
        The latter ultimately formed the first orchestral [[guild]] in Argentina,
        the Orchestra Professionals'' Association (APO), in 1919.<ref name=history>[http://www.historiasinfonica.blogspot.com/

        BA was the first Creamfields festival to be organised outside of [[Cream (nightclub)|Cream''s]]
        hometown of [[Liverpool]], but the move to Buenos Aires was seen as a risky
        one as it coincided with [[Argentina]] falling into [[Argentine economic crisis

        Aires architecture is characterized by its eclectic nature, with elements
        resembling [[Barcelona]], [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]]. There is a mix, due to
        [[Immigration in Argentina|immigration]], of [[Spanish colonial architecture|Colonial]],
        [[Art Deco]], [[Art Nouveau]], [[Neo-Gothic]] and [[House of Bourbon|French
        Bourbon]] styles.<ref>[http://www.bue.gov.ar/?ncMenu=49 Portal Oficial de

        after the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]]
        at the beginning of the 19th century, though the academic style persisted
        until the first decades of the 20th century.\n\nAttempts at renovation took
        place during the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the
        20th, when European influences penetrated into the country, reflected by several
        buildings of Buenos Aires such as the Iglesia Santa Felicitas by Ernesto Bunge;
        the Palace of Justice, the [[Argentine National Congress|National Congress]],
        all of them by [[Vittorio Meano]], and the [[Teatro Col\u00f3n]], by [[Francesco
        Tamburini]] and [[Vittorio Meano]].\n\nThe simplicity of the ''''[[R\u00edo
        de la Plata|Rioplatense]]'''' [[baroque|baroque style]] can be clearly seen
        in Buenos Aires through the works of Italian architects such as Andr\u00e9
        Blanqui and Antonio Masella, in the churches of [[Saint Ignatius Church (Buenos
        Aires)|San Ignacio]], [[Our Lady of the Pillar|Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar]],
        the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral|Cathedral]] and the [[Buenos Aires
        Cabildo|Cabildo]].\n\nIn 1912 the Basilica del Santisimo Sacramento was opened
        to the public. Totally built by the generous donation of Mrs. Mercedes Castellanos
        de Anchorena, Argentina''s most prominent family, the church is an excellent
        example of French neo-classicism. With extremely high-grade decorations in
        its interior, the magnificent Mutin-Cavaill\u00e9 coll organ (the biggest
        ever installed in an Argentine church with more than four-thousand tubes and
        four manuals) presided the nave. The altar is full of marble, and was the
        biggest ever built in South America at that time.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/Celebran-anos-cripta-Santisimo-Sacramento_0_504549647.html

        began. This was South America''s tallest building at the time, and was the
        first Argentine skyscraper built with concrete (1919\u20131923).<ref>{{cite

        plus a 20-metre high lobby hall with paintings in the ceiling and Latin phrases
        embossed in golden bronze letters. A 300,000-candela beacon was installed
        at the top (110 m), making the building visible even from Uruguay. In 2009
        the Barolo Palace went under an exhausive restoration, and the beacon was
        made operational again.\n\nIn 1936 the [[Kavanagh building]] was inaugurated,
        with 120 metres height, 12 elevators (provided by Otis) and the world''s first
        central air-conditioning system (provided by north-American company \"Carrier\"),
        is still an architectural landmark in Buenos Aires.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/capital_federal/Vivir-Kavanagh-lujo-vecinos-perfil_0_523147815.html

        24 July 2011</ref>\n\nThe architecture of the second half of the 20th century
        continued to reproduce French [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassic]] models,
        such as the headquarters of the Banco de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina built by
        [[Alejandro Bustillo]], and the Museo Hispanoamericano de Buenos Aires of
        Mart\u00edn Noel. However, since the 1930s the influence of [[Le Corbusier]]
        and European [[rationalism]] consolidated in a group of young architects from
        the [[National University of Tucum\u00e1n|University of Tucum\u00e1n]], among
        whom [[architecture|Amancio Williams]] stands out. The construction of skyscrapers
        proliferated in Buenos Aires until the 1950s. Newer modern high-technology
        buildings by Argentine architects in the last years of the 20th century and
        the beginning of the 21st include the Le Parc Tower by Mario \u00c1lvarez,
        the Torre Fortabat by S\u00e1nchez El\u00eda and the [[Repsol-YPF tower]]
        by [[C\u00e9sar Pelli]].\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|Education in Argentina}}\n\n===Primary

        in the city still adhere to the traditional seven-year primary school, but
        kids can do grades 1\u20136 if their high schools lasts 6 years, such as [[ORT

        education in Argentina is called ''''Polimodal'''' (\"polymodal\", that is,
        having multiple modes), since it allows the student to choose his/her orientation.
        Polimodal is usually 3 years of schooling, although some schools have a fourth
        year. Before entering the first year of polimodal, students choose an orientation,
        among these five: ''''Humanities and Social Sciences'''', ''''Economics and
        Management of Organizations'''','''' Art and Design'''', ''''Health and Sport''''
        and ''''Biology and Natural Sciences''''.\n\nNevertheless, in Buenos Aires,
        secondary education consists of 5 years, called from 1st year to 5th year,
        as opposed to primary education''s 1st to 7th grade. Most schools don''t require
        students to choose their orientation, as they study the basic such as maths,
        biology, art, history and technology, but there are schools that do, whether
        they are orientated to a certain profession or they have orientations to choose
        from when they reach a specific year.\n\nSome high schools depend on the [[University
        of Buenos Aires]], and these require an admission course when students are
        taking the last year of high school. These high schools are [[Instituto Libre
        de Segunda Ense\u00f1anza|ILSE]], [[CNBA]], [[Escuela Superior de Comercio
        Carlos Pellegrini]] and Escuela de Educaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica Profesional
        en Producci\u00f3n Agropecuaria y Agroalimentaria (School of Professional
        Technique Education in Agricultural and Agri-food Production). The last two
        do have a specific orientation.\n\nIn December 2006 the [[Argentine Chamber
        of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] of the [[Argentine National Congress|Argentine
        Congress]] passed a new National Education Law restoring the old system of
        primary followed by secondary education, making secondary education obligatory
        and a right, and increasing the length of compulsory education to 13 years.
        The government vowed to put the law in effect gradually, starting in 2007.<ref>{{cite
