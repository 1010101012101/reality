        refused an order to kill him, for which Han was dismissed from the Imperial

        suit was made of more comfortable materials, though Mayhew''s filming only
        lasted a day. Only Mayhew''s blue eyes could be seen in his costume, but fans

        voice was created by the original films'' [[sound designer]], [[Ben Burtt]],
        from recordings of [[walrus]]es, lions, [[camel]]s, bears, rabbits, tigers,
        and [[badger]]s in Burtt''s personal [[menagerie]].<ref name=\"PMB\"/> The
        individual recordings were mixed at different ratios for Chewbacca''s different

        who hand knitted the torso section. During preproduction of ''''[[The Force

        the original suit was far more sophisticated than they had originally realized,
        leading him to entirely scrap their first attempt at making the new suit,
        go back and study Freeborn''s work in order to better appreciate how it worked,

        and [[droid (robot)|droids]] [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] to the planet [[Alderaan]].<ref>''''Star
        Wars Episode IV''''</ref> When they find the planet destroyed by the [[Death
        Star]], the two smugglers are drawn into the [[Rebel Alliance]]. As part of
        a plan to rescue Leia, Luke tries to put handcuffs on Chewbacca to make it
        look like he''s a prisoner. Chewbacca almost attacks Luke believing him to
        be selling him and Solo out, but Han explains that he knows what Luke has
        in mind and convinces the Wookiee to play along. After rescuing Leia and taking
        her to the rebel base on Yavin IV, the two smugglers are given reward money
        in the value of a payload lost by him to which he owes [[Jabba The Hutt]].
        Somehow, Chewbacca is able to convince Han to put his debt to Jabba aside
        for the time being and help The Rebels in their fight against the evil Galactic
        Empire''s Death Star . They manage to save Luke from being killed, also allowing
        him to be the one to destroy the space station.\n\nIn ''''[[The Empire Strikes
        Back]]'''' (1980), Chewbacca finds a dismantled C-3PO in a junk pile in Cloud
        City and rescues him from being melted down. He later tries to repair him,
        but does a terrible job at it. Before Han is frozen in carbonite, he asks
        Chewbacca to look after [[Princess Leia]] for him. When [[Lando Calrissian]]
        is able to save Leia and Chewbacca from being taken to [[Darth Vader|Darth
        Vader''s]] ship, he uncuffs the Wookie, who upon release starts strangling
        him for selling them out. When Lando explains that they still have a chance
        to save Han, Leia has Chewbacca stop choking him. Even though they''re unsuccessful
        at saving the frozen Han, they make it back to the ''''Falcon'''' with R2-D2.
        Chewbacca carried C-3PO on his back throughout their escape to the ''''Falcon''''.
        When Leia hears Luke''s cry for help, she has Chewbacca turn the ship around
        to rescue him. After doing so, they attempt the jump to lightspeed but fail,
        even after Lando''s men fixed it. Chewbacca is furious at Lando and goes to
        fix it himself, having spent part of the movie trying to do so. What none
        of them except for R2-D2 realize is that the hyperdrive had been deactivated
        by the Empire, which R2-D2 had learned from Cloud City''s central computer
        while helping them escape. Admiral Firmus Piett''s men disguised themselves
        as Lando''s repairmen and deactivated the hyperdrive as part of Vader''s plan
        to capture Luke and turn him to the dark side of the Force, but R2-D2 is able
        to fix it allowing them to make the jump to hyperspeed and get to the Rebel
        fleet. While Luke heals and is given a robotic right hand to replace the one
        he lost against Vader, Lando and Chewbacca prepare to leave to find [[Jabba
        the Hutt]] and [[Boba Fett]] and rescue Han.\n\nIn ''''[[Return of the Jedi]]''''
        (1983), Chewbacca pretends to be the prisoner of a bounty hunter named Boushh,
        which is actually Leia in disguise as part of Luke''s plan to rescue Han from
        Jabba the Hutt. During the Battle of Endor, Chewbacca and some Ewoks commandeer
        an AT-ST from the empire and use it to shoot down other walkers and imperial
        troops.<ref>''''Star Wars Episodes V'''' & ''''VI''''</ref>\n\n====Prequels
        and sequels====\nIn the 2005 [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel film]] ''''[[Star
        Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'''', Chewbacca and [[List of
        Star Wars Old Republic characters#Tarfful|Tarfful]] fight in the [[Clone Wars
        (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] when their planet [[Kashyyyk]] is invaded by the
        Separatist Alliance. They also help  [[Yoda]] escape his clone troopers, who
        had been ordered to kill him. Chewbacca is not identified until Yoda says
        goodbye to him at the end of a scene.\n\nOn April 7, 2014, it was confirmed
        that Mayhew would reprise his role as Chewbacca in ''''[[Star Wars: The Force
        Awakens]]''''. In the film, set 30 years after ''''Return of the Jedi'''',
        he and Han are piloting a cargo vessel and find the ''''Millennium Falcon'''',
        which had been stolen from them. Chewbacca and Han help the rogue stormtrooper
        [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]], the scavenger [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] and the droid
        [[BB-8]] escape from a gang of mercenaries on board the ''''Falcon''''. They
        then fly to [[Maz Kanata|Maz Kanata''s]] castle so that Maz could help them
        get BB-8 to the Resistance. But before Chewbacca and the gang could get Maz''s
        help, the First Order attacks the castle and captures Rey while Chewbacca,
        Finn, and Han are saved by X-wing pilots led by [[Poe Dameron]]. Without Rey,
        they fly to a Resistance base, where Chewbacca and Han reunite with Leia,
        C-3PO, and R2-D2. They also soon reunite with Rey, who escaped from the First
        Order. Chewbacca helps in the fight between the Resistance and First Order.
        When Han is killed by his son [[Kylo Ren]] during the battle, an enraged Chewbacca
        shoots Ren in the side, leaving him severely weakened, kills many Stormtroopers
        and then sets off explosives that allows Poe and other X-wing pilots to destroy
        Starkiller Base, the First Order''s battle station. Chewbacca shortly thereafter
        rescues Rey and Finn from the wilderness of Starkiller Base following their
        duel with Ren. As Starkiller Base blows up, Chewbacca escapes in the ''''Falcon''''
        with Finn and Rey, and later, along with R2-D2, helps Rey find Luke.\n\nThe
        Wrap reports that Chewbacca will appear in the upcoming Star Wars Anthology
        Han Solo spin off film, which will see a May 25, 2018 release.<ref>{{cite

        but it seems unable to work. Later, he and Ahsoka attack the Trandoshan fortress,
        killing many in sight, before they are found and assisted by other Wookiees

        ''''Star Wars Holiday Special'''' consisted of a [[frame story]] in which  Chewbacca
        and Han must prevent [[Darth Vader]] from spoiling Life Day, and get home
        to be with Chewbacca''s family. It aired only once.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwarsholidayspecial.com/text/faq.htm|title=Star
        Wars Holiday Special|work=starwarsholidayspecial.com}}</ref>\n\n====Books====\nChewbacca
        appears in the Han Solo Adventures trilogy of books written by Brian Daley,
        including ''''Han Solo at Stars'' End'''', ''''Han Solo''s Revenge'''' and
        ''''Han Solo and the Lost Legacy'''', originally published between 1979 and
        1980.\n\nChewbacca''s family also appears in the non-canon ''''Star Wars''''
        Legends books (''''Star Wars'''' books published before December 2014), most
        notably ''''The Wookiee Storybook'''', ''''[[The Black Fleet Crisis]]''''
        trilogy by [[Michael P. Kube-McDowell]], and ''''[[The Hutt Gambit]]'''' and
        ''''[[Rebel Dawn]]'''' by [[A. C. Crispin]]. The latter also introduces other
        family members, including a sister named [[List of Star Wars characters#Kallabow|Kallabow]]
        and cousins named Dryanta and Jowdrrl, as well as the matriarch, Ellen.\n\nIn
        the novel ''''[[Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader]]'''', set just after the
        events in ''''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Revenge
        of the Sith]]'''', Chewbacca is forced to leave Kashyyyk after he narrowly
        escapes a major Imperial attack on the planet. [[Darth Vader]] and [[Emperor
        Palpatine]] enslave most of Kashyyyk''s population for forced labor on the
        construction of the Death Star. To escape, he joins a ship of smugglers who
        are friendly to the [[Jedi]].\n\nThe novel ''''[[The Hutt Gambit]]'''' explains
        how Chewbacca and Han first meet when Han, a lieutenant in the Imperial Navy,
        finds him unconscious aboard a [[Slavery|slave]] ship. Han''s commanding officer
        orders him to skin Chewbacca, but Han refuses and rescues the helpless prisoner.
        Upon regaining consciousness, Chewbacca swears a \"life-debt\" to Han, and
        the two become business partners and best friends.<ref>''''Hutt Gambit''''</ref>\n\nIn
        the book ''''[[Heirs of the Force]]'''', part of the ''''[[Young Jedi Knights]]''''
        series, Chewbacca has a nephew, Kallabow''s son named [[List of Star Wars
        characters#Lowbacca|Lowbacca]] who goes to the [[Jedi Academy]].\n\nIn the
        1999 novel ''''[[Vector Prime]]'''' by [[R. A. Salvatore]], the first in the
        ''''[[New Jedi Order]]'''' series, Chewbacca sacrifices his life to save Han''s
        son [[Anakin Solo|Anakin]] from a collision between the planet Sernpidal and
        one of its moons. Lumpawarrump and Lowbacca offer to assume Chewbacca''s life
        debt to Han.\n\nChewbacca appears in the third book of the ''''[[The Strange
        Case of Origami Yoda|Origami Yoda]]'''' series, ''''The Secret of the Fortune
        Wookie'''' (in [[origami]] form) and in some of the subsequent books of the
        series.\n\n[[Lucasfilm]] followed ''''Vector Prime'''' with a four-issue comic
        book titled ''''Star Wars: Chewbacca'''', in which C-3PO and R2-D2 travel
        the galaxy to collect the stories of beings who knew or met the Wookiee.\n\n====Video
        games====\nIn the fighting game ''''[[Star Wars: Masters of Ter\u00e4s K\u00e4si]]'''',
        Chewbacca is a playable character.\n\nIn ''''[[Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi
        Academy]]'''', Chewbacca appears briefly at the [[Mos Eisley]] spaceport as
        an NPC, assisting [[Jaden Korr]] in disabling the tractor beams holding both
        the ''''[[Millennium Falcon]]'''' and the Raven''s Claw captive.<ref>''''Jedi
        Academy''''</ref>\n\nIn LucasArts'' game ''''[[Kinect Star Wars]]'''', the
        player acts as gunner on a spacecraft piloted by a young Chewbacca.\n\nIn
        ''''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]'''', ''''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade
        Squadron]]'''' and ''''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron]]'''', Chewbacca
        is a playable hero on the rebels side.\n\nHe was a playable (LEGO version)
        character in ''''[[Lego Star Wars: The Original Trilogy]]'''' and ''''[[Lego
        Star Wars: The Video Game]]'''' as he had a big role in the original trilogy
        movies but is only in one level in ''''The Video Game''''. The level is where
        Chewbacca''s home is under attack, Yoda helps him and so at the end of the
        level Chewbacca and another Wookie lead him to a space pod to escape, just
        as in the film.\n\nChewbacca will be a playabale character on the Death Star
        DLC from Star Wars: Battlefront 2015, which will come out on September.<ref>{{cite

        V: The Empire Strikes Back|the Special Edition re-release of ''''The Empire
        Strikes Back'''']] declared that the character gave the worst performance
        of the film: \"This character was thrown into the first film as window dressing,
        was never thought through, and as a result has been saddled with one facial
        expression and one mournful yelp. Much more could have been done. How can
        you be a space pilot and not be able to communicate in any meaningful way?
        Does Han Solo really understand Chew''s monotonous noises? Do they have long
        chats sometimes?\"<ref name=\"Ebert Review\">{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970221/REVIEWS/702210302/1023

        is one of the few fictional characters to receive a [[Lifetime Achievement
        Award]] at the [[MTV Movie Awards]]. Because fans complained that he should
        have received a medal along with [[Luke Skywalker]] and Han Solo at the end
        of ''''A New Hope'''', [[MTV]] presented the award as a medal bestowed by
        [[Carrie Fisher]]. Peter Mayhew had voiced concern about Chewbacca being skipped
        in the original medal scene as well, but noted that Chewbacca does get the
        last \"line\" in the film as compensation.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External
