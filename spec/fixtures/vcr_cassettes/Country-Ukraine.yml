        making it the largest [[country]] entirely within [[Europe]] and the [[List
        of countries and dependencies by area|46th]] largest country in the world,
        and a population of about 44.5 million, making it the [[List of countries
        and dependencies by population|32nd]] most populous country in the world.\n\nThe
        territory of modern Ukraine has been inhabited since 32,000 BC. During the
        [[Middle Ages]], the area was a key centre of [[List of Slavic cultures|East
        Slavic culture]], with the powerful state of [[Kievan Rus'']] forming the
        basis of Ukrainian identity. Following its fragmentation in the 13th century,
        the territory was contested, ruled and divided by a variety of powers, including
        [[Lithuania]], Poland, the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and Russia.
        A [[Cossack Hetmanate|Cossack republic]] emerged and prospered during the
        17th and 18th centuries, but its territory was eventually split between Poland
        and the Russian Empire, and later submerged fully into Russia. Two brief periods
        of independence occurred during the 20th century, once near the end of [[World
        War I]] and another during [[World War II]], but both occasions would ultimately
        see Ukraine''s territories conquered and consolidated into a [[Ukrainian Soviet
        Socialist Republic|Soviet republic]], a situation that persisted until 1991,
        when Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union in the aftermath
        of its [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] at the end of the [[Cold
        War]].\n\nFollowing independence, Ukraine declared itself a neutral state.<ref

        country and the [[Europe#Territories and regions|second largest country]]
        in Europe (after the European part of Russia, before [[metropolitan France]]).{{Ref

        meridian east|22\u00b0]] and [[41st meridian east|41\u00b0 E]].\n\nThe landscape
        of Ukraine consists mostly of fertile plains (or [[steppes]]) and plateaus,
        crossed by rivers such as the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] ({{lang|uk-Latn|''''Dnipro''''}}),
        [[Seversky Donets]], [[Dniester]] and the [[Southern Bug|Southern Buh]] as
        they flow south into the [[Black Sea]] and the smaller [[Sea of Azov]]. To
        the southwest, the [[Danube Delta|delta]] of the [[Danube]] forms the border
        with Romania. Its various regions have diverse geographic features ranging
        from the highlands to the lowlands. The country''s only mountains are the
        [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, of which the highest is the [[Hora Hoverla]]
        at {{convert|2061|m}}, and the [[Crimean Mountains]] on Crimea, in the extreme

        regions such as the Volyn-Podillia Upland (in the west) and the Near-Dnipro
        Upland (on the right bank of Dnieper); to the east there are the south-western
        spurs of the Central Russian Uplands over which runs the border with Russian
        Federation. Near the Sea of Azov can be found the Donets Ridge and the Near
        Azov Upland. The [[snow melt]] from the mountains feeds the rivers, and natural
        changes in altitude form a sudden drop in elevation and create many opportunities

        of Ukraine may be divided into three major aggregations: a zone of sandy podzolized
        soils; a central belt consisting of the black, extremely fertile Ukrainian
        ([[Chornozem|chernozems]]); and a zone of chestnut and salinized soils.<ref
        name=\"britannica.com\">[http://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine Ukraine |
        history \u2013 geography | Britannica.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs
        much as two-thirds of the country''s surface land consists of the so-called
        black earth ([[chornozem]]), a resource that has made Ukraine one of the most
        fertile regions in the world and famously called a \"breadbasket.\"<ref>Magocsi,
        Paul R. A history of Ukraine: The land and its peoples. University of Toronto
        Press, 2010.</ref> These ([[chornozem]]) soils may be divided into three broad
        groups: in the north a belt of the so-called deep chernozems, about 5 feet
        (1.5 meters) thick and rich in humus; south and east of the former, a zone
        of prairie, or ordinary, chernozems, which are equally rich in humus but only
        about 3 feet (1 meter) thick; and the southernmost belt, which is even thinner
        and has still less humus. Interspersed in various uplands and along the northern
        and western perimeters of the deep chernozems are mixtures of gray forest
        soils and podzolized black-earth soils, which together occupy much of Ukraine\u2019s
        remaining area. All these soils are very fertile when sufficient water is
        available. However, their intensive cultivation, especially on steep slopes,
        has led to widespread soil erosion and gullying.\n\nThe smallest proportion
        of the soil cover consists of the chestnut soils of the southern and eastern
        regions. They become increasingly salinized to the south as they approach
        the Black Sea.<ref name=\"britannica.com\" />\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\nUkraine
        is home to a very wide range of animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants.\n\n====

        divided into two main zoological areas. One of these areas, in the west of
        the country, is made up of the borderlands of Europe, where there are species
        typical of mixed forests, the other is located in eastern Ukraine, where steppe-dwelling
        species thrive. In the forested areas of the country it is not uncommon to
        find lynxes, wolves, wild boar and martens, as well as many other similar
        species; this is especially true of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], where a
        large number of predatory mammals make their home, as well as a contingent
        of brown bears. Around Ukraine''s lakes and rivers beavers, otters and mink
        make their home, whilst within, carp, bream and catfish are the most commonly
        found species of fish. In the central and eastern parts of the country, rodents
        such as hamsters and gophers are found in large numbers.\n\n==== Fungi ====\nMore
        than 6,600 [[species]] of [[Fungus|fungi]] (including [[lichen]]-forming species)

        election], [[Kyiv Post]] (9 February 2010)</ref>]]\n\nWith the proclamation
        of its independence on 24 August 1991, and adoption of a constitution on 28
        June 1996, Ukraine became a semi-presidential republic. However, in 2004,
        deputies introduced changes to the Constitution, which tipped the balance
        of power in favour of a [[parliamentary system]]. From 2004 to 2010, the legitimacy
        of the 2004 Constitutional amendments had official sanction, both with the
        Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and most major political parties.<ref name=\"1oct\">{{cite

        this, on 30 September 2010 the Constitutional Court ruled that the amendments
        were null and void, forcing a return to the terms of the 1996 Constitution
        and again making Ukraine''s political system more presidential in character.\n\nThe
        ruling on the 2004 Constitutional amendments became a major topic of political
        discourse. Much of the concern was based on the fact that neither the Constitution
        of 1996 nor the Constitution of 2004 provided the ability to \"undo the Constitution\",
        as the decision of the Constitutional Court would have it, even though the
        2004 constitution arguably has an exhaustive list of possible procedures for
        constitutional amendments (articles 154\u2013159). In any case, the current
        Constitution could be modified by a vote in Parliament.<ref name=\"1oct\"

        control over local budgets. The heads of regional and district administrations
        are appointed by the President in accordance with the proposals of the Prime
        Minister. This system virtually requires an agreement between the President
        and the Prime Minister, and has in the past led to problems, such as when
        President Yushchenko exploited a perceived loophole by appointing so-called
        ''temporarily acting'' officers, instead of actual governors or local leaders,
        thus evading the need to seek a compromise with the Prime Minister. This practice
        was controversial and was subject to Constitutional Court review.\n\nUkraine
        has a large number of political parties, many of which have tiny memberships
        and are unknown to the general public.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

        been much improved since Ukraine''s independence in 1991. The Supreme Court
        is regarded as an independent and impartial body, and has on several occasions
        ruled against the Ukrainian government. The [[World Justice Project]] ranks

        populated places are split further into cities and [[urban-type settlement]]s
        (a Soviet administrative invention), while rural populated places consist
        of villages and settlements (a generally used term). All cities have certain
        degree of self-rule depending on their significance such as national significance
        (as in the case of Kiev and Sevastopol), regional significance (within each
        oblast or autonomous republic) or district significance (all the rest of cities).
        City''s significance depends on several factors such as its population, socio-economic
        and historical importance, infrastructure and others.\n\nFollowing the [[2014
        Crimean crisis]], [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea|Crimea]] and [[Sevastopol]]

        Ukraine, as of 2010, is 10.8 births/1,000 population, and the death rate is
        15.2 deaths/1,000 population (see [[Demographics of Ukraine|Ukraine demographic
        tables]]).\n\nThe phenomenon of lowest-low fertility, defined as total fertility
        below 1.3, is emerging throughout Europe and is attributed by many to postponement
        of the initiation of childbearing. Ukraine, where total fertility (a very
        low 1.1 in 2001), was one of the world''s lowest, shows that there is more
        than one pathway to lowest-low fertility. Although Ukraine has undergone immense
        political and economic transformations during 1991\u20132004, it has maintained
        a young age at first birth and nearly universal childbearing. Analysis of
        official national statistics and the Ukrainian Reproductive Health Survey
        show that fertility declined to very low levels without a transition to a
        later pattern of childbearing. Findings from focus group interviews suggest
        explanations of the early fertility pattern. These findings include the persistence
        of traditional norms for childbearing and the roles of men and women, concerns
        about medical complications and infertility at a later age, and the link between
        early fertility and early marriage.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Perelli-Harris

        later used for university admissions.\n\nThe first higher education institutions
        (HEIs) emerged in Ukraine during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The
        first Ukrainian higher education institution was the [[Ostroh Academy|Ostrozka
        School]], or Ostrozkiy Greek-Slavic-Latin Collegium, similar to Western European
        higher education institutions of the time. Established in 1576 in the town
        of [[Ostroh|Ostrog]], the Collegium was the first higher education institution
        in the [[East Slavic peoples|Eastern Slavic]] territories. The oldest university
        was the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kyiv Mohyla Academy]],
        first established in 1632 and in 1694 officially recognised by the government
        of [[Imperial Russia]] as a higher education institution. Among the oldest
        is also the [[Lviv University]], founded in 1661. More higher education institutions
        were set up in the 19th century, beginning with universities in [[Kharkiv
        University|Kharkiv]] (1805), [[Kiev University|Kiev]] (1834), [[Odessa University|Odessa]]
        (1865) and [[Chernivtsi University|Chernivtsi]] (1875) and a number of professional
        higher education institutions, e.g.: [[Nizhyn Pedagogical University|Nizhyn
        Historical and Philological Institute]] (originally established as the Gymnasium
        of Higher Sciences in 1805), a Veterinary Institute (1873) and a [[Kharkiv
        Polytechnical Institute|Technological Institute]] (1885) in [[Kharkiv]], a
        [[Kiev Polytechnic Institute|Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Kiev]] (1898) and
        a Higher Mining School (1899) in [[Dnipropetrovsk|Katerynoslav]]. Rapid growth
        followed in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet]] period. By
        1988 a number of higher education institutions increased to 146 with over
        850,000 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001465/146552e.pdf

        largest number of [[Tertiary education|post-secondary graduates]] in Europe,
        while being ranked seventh in population. [[Higher education in Ukraine|higher
        education]] is either state funded or private. Students that study at state
        expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end-of-term
        exams and differentiated test suffice; this rule may be different in some
        universities.  For highest grades, the scholarship is increased by 25%. For
        most students the government subsidy is not sufficient to cover their basic
        living expenses.  Most universities provide subsidised housing for out-of-city
        students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all
        registered students.  Ukrainian universities confer two degrees: the bachelor''s
        degree (4&nbsp;years) and the master''s degree (5\u20136th&nbsp;year), in
        accordance with the [[Bologna process]]. Historically, [[Specialist degree]]

        After the entire egg was dyed, the wax was removed leaving only the colourful

        Parque Tingui.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional Ukrainian village [[Ukrainian architecture|architecture]]
        in [[Curitiba]], Brazil, where a large [[Ukrainian diaspora]] is.]]\nUkrainian
        architecture is a term that describes the motifs and styles that are found
        in structures built in modern Ukraine, and by [[Ukrainians]] worldwide.\nThese
        include initial roots which were established in the [[Eastern Slavs|Eastern
        Slavic]] state of [[Kievan Rus'']]. After the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|12th
        century]], the distinct [[architectural history]] continued in the principalities
        of [[Galicia-Volhynia]]. During the epoch of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]],
        a new style unique to Ukraine was developed under the western influences of
        the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. After the union with the [[Tsardom
        of Russia]], many structures in the larger eastern, Russian-ruled area were
        built in the styles of [[Russian architecture]] of that period, whilst the
        western [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] was developed under [[Architecture
        of Austria|Austro-Hungarian architectural influences]]. Ukrainian national
        motifs would finally be used during the period of the [[Soviet Union]] and
        in modern independent Ukraine.\n\nThe great [[Architecture of Kievan Rus|churches
        of the Rus'']], built after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus''|adoption of Christianity]]
        in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic
        lands. The architectural style of the Kievan state was strongly influenced
        by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches
        were mainly made of wood, with the simplest form of church becoming known
        as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes,
        which led some art historians to take this as an indication of the appearance
        of pre-Christian pagan Slavic temples.\n\nSeveral examples of these churches
        survive; however, during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, many were externally
        rebuilt in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style (see below). Examples include the
        grand [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|St. Sophia of Kiev]]&nbsp;\u2013 the
        year 1017 is the earliest record of foundation laid, [[Church of the Saviour
        at Berestove]] \u2013 built from 1113 to 1125 and [[St. Cyril''s Monastery|St.
        Cyril''s Church]], circa 12th-century. All can still be found in the Ukrainian
        capital. Several buildings were reconstructed during the late-19th century,
        including the [[:File:WladimirWolynsk Uspenski Cathedral.jpeg|Assumption Cathedral]]
        in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], built in 1160 and reconstructed in 1896\u20131900,
        the [[:File:AX Chernigiv Pyatnitska Church.jpg|Paraskevi church in Chernihiv]],
        built in 1201 with reconstruction done in the late 1940s, and the [[Golden
        Gate (Kiev)|Golden gates in Kiev]], built in 1037 and reconstructed in 1982.
        The latter''s reconstruction was criticised by some art and architecture historians
        as a revivalist fantasy. Unfortunately little secular or [[vernacular architecture]]
        of [[Kievan Rus'']] has survived.\n\nAs Ukraine became increasingly integrated
        into the [[Russian Empire]], Russian architects had the opportunity to realise
        their projects in the picturesque landscape that many Ukrainian cities and
        regions offered. [[St. Andrew''s Church of Kiev]] (1747\u20131754), built
        by [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]], is a notable example of [[Baroque]] architecture,
        and its location on top of the Kievan mountain made it a recognisable monument
        of the city. An equally notable contribution of Rasetrelli was the [[Mariyinsky
        Palace]], which was built to be a summer residence to Russian Empress [[Elizabeth
        of Russia|Elizabeth]]. During the reign of the last [[Hetmans of Ukrainian
        Cossacks|Hetman of Ukraine]], [[Kirill Razumovsky]], many of the [[Cossack
        Hetmanate]]''s towns such as [[Hlukhiv]], [[Baturyn]] and [[Koselets]] had
        grandiose projects built by [[Andrey Kvasov]]. Russia eventually conquered
        the south of Ukraine and Crimea, and renamed them as [[New Russia]].  New
        cities such as [[Mykolayiv|Nikolayev]], [[Odessa]], [[Kherson]] and [[Sevastopol]]
        were founded. These would contain notable examples of Imperial Russian architecture.\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:\u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0433\u0456\u0432.\u0421\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440

        in [[Kharkiv]]\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\nIn 1934, the capital of Soviet Ukraine
        moved from [[Kharkiv]] to [[Kiev]]. Previously, the city was seen as only
        a regional centre, hence received little attention. All of that was to change,
        at great price. The first examples of [[Stalinist architecture]] were already
        showing, and, in light of the official policy, a new city was to be built
        on top of the old one. This meant that much-admired examples such as the [[St.
        Michael''s Golden-Domed Monastery]] were destroyed. Even the St. Sophia Cathedral
        was under threat. Also, the Second World War contributed to the wreckage.
        After the war, a new project for the reconstruction of central Kiev transformed
        [[Khreshchatyk]] avenue into a notable example of Stalinism in Architecture.
        However, by 1955, the new politics of architecture once again stopped the
        project from fully being realised.\n\nThe task for modern Ukrainian architecture
        is diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect''s
        own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment.
        An example of modern Ukrainian architecture is the reconstruction and renewal
        of the [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] in central Kiev. Despite the limit set by
        narrow space within the plaza, the engineers were able to blend together the
        uneven landscape, and use underground space for a new shopping centre.\n\nA
        major project, which may take up most of the 21st century, is the construction

        Mamay 1st half of 19th c (4).jpg|thumb|[[Cossack Mamay]] playing a [[kobza]]]]\n\nMusic
        is a major part of Ukrainian culture, with a long history and many influences.
        From traditional [[folk music]], to [[classical music|classical]] and [[modern
        rock]], Ukraine has produced several internationally recognised musicians
        including [[Kirill Karabits]], [[Okean Elzy]] and [[Ruslana]]. Elements from
        traditional Ukrainian folk music made their way into Western music and even
        into [[modern jazz]].\n\n[[File:\u041b\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e
        \u041c\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|[[Mykola Lysenko]]
        is widely considered to be the father of Ukrainian classical music{{citation
        needed|date=June 2015}}]]\n\nUkrainian music sometimes presents a perplexing
        mix of exotic melismatic singing with chordal harmony. The most striking general
        characteristic of authentic ethnic Ukrainian folk music is the wide use of
        minor modes or keys which incorporate augmented 2nd intervals.\n\nDuring the
        Baroque period, music was an important discipline for those that had received
        a higher education in Ukraine. It had a place of considerable importance in
        the curriculum of the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]. Much of the nobility was well
        versed in music with many Ukrainian Cossack leaders such as (Mazepa, Paliy,
        Holovatyj, Sirko) being accomplished players of the [[kobza]], [[bandura]]
        or [[torban]].\n\nThe first dedicated musical academy was set up in Hlukhiv,
        Ukraine in 1738 and students were taught to sing, play violin and bandura
        from manuscripts. As a result, many of the earliest composers and performers
        within the Russian empire were ethnically Ukrainian, having been born or educated
        in Hlukhiv, or had been closely associated with this music school.\nSee: [[Dmytro
        Bortniansky]], [[Maksym Berezovsky]] and [[Artemy Vedel|Artemiy Vedel]].\n\n[[File:Rapid
        Trident 2014 06.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian Dance ''''[[Hopak]]''''.]]\n\nUkrainian
        classical music falls into three distinct categories defined by whether the
        composer was of Ukrainian ethnicity living in Ukraine, a composer of non-Ukrainian
        ethnicity who was born or at some time was a citizen of Ukraine, or an ethnic
        Ukrainian living outside of Ukraine within the [[Ukrainian diaspora]]. The
        music of these three groups differs considerably, as do the audiences for
        whom they cater.\n\nSince the mid-1960s, Western-influenced pop music has
        been growing in popularity in Ukraine. Folk singer and harmonium player [[Mariana
        Sadovska]] is prominent. Ukrainian pop and folk music arose with the international
        popularity of groups and performers like [[Vopli Vidoplyasova]], [[Dakh Daughters]],
        [[Dakha Brakha]], [[Ivan Dorn]] and [[Okean Elzy]].\n\n=== Cinema ===\n{{Main|Cinema
        of Ukraine}}\nUkraine has had an influence on the history of the cinema. Ukrainian
        directors [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], often cited as one of the most important
        early Soviet filmmakers, as well as being a pioneer of [[Soviet montage theory]],
        [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]], and [[Sergei Parajanov]], Armenian film director
        and artist who made significant contributions to Ukrainian, Armenian and Georgian
        cinema. He invented his own cinematic style, Ukrainian poetic cinema, which
        was totally out of step with the guiding principles of socialist realism.\n\n[[File:Muratova.jpg|upright|thumbnail|[[Kira
        Muratova]]]]\n\nOther important directors including [[Kira Muratova]], [[Larisa
        Shepitko]], [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], [[Leonid Bykov]], [[Yuri Ilyenko]], [[Leonid
        Osyka]], [[Ihor Podolchak]] with his [[Delirium (2013 film)|Delirium]] and
        [[Maryna Vroda]]. Many Ukrainian actors have achieved international fame and
        critical success, including: [[Vera Kholodnaya]], [[Bohdan Stupka]], [[Milla
        Jovovich]], [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mila Kunis]].\n\nDespite a history of important
        and successful productions, the industry has often been characterised by a
        debate about its identity and the level of Russian and European influence.
        Ukrainian producers are active in international co-productions and Ukrainian
        actors, directors and crew feature regularly in Russian (Soviet in past) films.
        Also successful films have been based on Ukrainian people, stories or events,
        including [[Battleship Potemkin]], [[Man with a Movie Camera]], [[Everything
        Is Illuminated (film)|Everything Is Illuminated]].\n\nUkrainian State Film
        Agency owns [[National Oleksandr Dovzhenko Film Centre]], film copying laboratory
        and archive, takes part in hosting of the [[Odessa International Film Festival]],
        and [[Molodist]] is the only one [[FIAPF]] accredited International Film Festival
        held in Ukraine; competition program is devoted to student, first short and

        a significant national media centre. The National News Agency of Ukraine,
        [[Ukrinform]] was founded here in 1918. The Ukraine publishing sector, including
        books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media,
        newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover. [[Sanoma]] publishing
        Ukrainian editions of such magazines as [[Esquire]], [[Harpers Bazaar]] and
        [[National Geographic Magazine]]. [[BBC Ukrainian]] started its broadcasts
        in 1992.\n\nUkrainians listen to radio programming, such as [[Radio Ukraine]]
        or [[Radio Liberty]], largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half
        hours a day. Several television channels operate, and many Websites are popular.\n\n===
