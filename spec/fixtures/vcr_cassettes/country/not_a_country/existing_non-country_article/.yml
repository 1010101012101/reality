        Baynes]] and originally published in London between October 1950 and September
        1956, ''''The Chronicles of Narnia'''' has been [[Adaptations of The Chronicles
        of Narnia|adapted several times]], complete or in part, for radio, television,
        the stage, and film.\n\nSet in the [[Fictional universe|fictional realm]]
        of [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]], a fantasy world of magic, mythical beasts, and
        talking animals, the series narrates the adventures of various children who
        play central roles in the unfolding history of that world. Except in ''''[[The
        Horse and His Boy]]'''', the [[protagonist]]s are all children from the real
        world, magically transported to Narnia, where they are called upon by the
        lion [[Aslan]] to protect Narnia from evil and restore the throne to its rightful
        line. The books span the entire history of Narnia, from its creation in ''''[[The
        Magician''s Nephew]]'''' to its eventual destruction in ''''[[The Last Battle]]''''.\n\nInspiration
        for the series is taken from multiple sources; in addition to adapting numerous
        traditional Christian themes, the books freely borrow characters and ideas
        from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]] as well as from traditional
        British and Irish fairy tales. The books have profoundly influenced adult
        and children''s fantasy literature since World War II. Lewis''s exploration
        of themes not usually present in children''s literature, such as religion,
        as well as the books'' perceived treatment of issues including race and gender,
        has caused some controversy.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Background and

        ''''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'''' until 1949. ''''[[The Magician''s
        Nephew]]'''', the penultimate book to be published, but the last to be written,
        was completed in 1954. Lewis did not write the books in the order in which
        they were originally published, nor were they published in their current chronological
        order of presentation.<ref name=\"Ford\">{{cite book |title=Companion to Narnia:

        illustrator, Pauline Baynes, created pen and ink drawings for the ''''Narnia''''
        books that are still used in the editions published today. Lewis was awarded
        the 1956 [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] for ''''The Last
        Battle'''', the final book in the saga. Fellow children''s author [[Roger
        Lancelyn Green]] first referred to the series as ''''The Chronicles of Narnia'''',
        in March 1951, after he had read and discussed with Lewis his recently completed
        fourth book ''''[[The Silver Chair]]'''', originally entitled ''''Night under
        Narnia''''.<ref>[[Roger Lancelyn Green]] & [[Walter Hooper]], ''''C. S. Lewis:
        A Biography''''. (2002), p. 311.</ref>\n\nLewis described the origin of ''''The
        Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'''' in an essay entitled \"It All Began with
        a Picture\":\n<blockquote>\nThe ''''Lion'''' all began with a picture of a
        [[Faun]] carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. This picture had
        been in my mind since I was about sixteen. Then one day, when I was about
        forty, I said to myself: ''Let''s try to make a story about it.''<ref>C. S.
        Lewis. ''''On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature''''. 1982, p. 53. ISBN

        [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|many children were
        evacuated]] to the English countryside in anticipation of attacks on London
        and other major urban areas by Nazi Germany. As a result, on 2 September 1939,

        came to live at [[The Kilns]] in [[Risinghurst]], Lewis'' home three miles
        east of [[Oxford]] city centre. Lewis later suggested that the experience
        gave him a new appreciation of children and in late September<ref>Owen Dudley

        p. 129. ISBN 978-0-7486-1650-3</ref> he began a children''s story on an odd
        sheet of paper which has survived as part of another manuscript:\n<blockquote>\nThis
        book is about four children whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter.
        But it is most about Peter who was the youngest. They all had to go away from
        London suddenly because of Air Raids, and because Father, who was in the Army,
        had gone off to the War and Mother was doing some kind of war work. They were
        sent to stay with a kind of relation of Mother''s who was a very old professor
        who lived all by himself in the country.<ref>[[Roger Lancelyn Green]] and

        All Began With a Picture\" C. S. Lewis continues:\n<blockquote>\nAt first
        I had very little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Aslan came
        bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about
        that time. Apart from that, I don''t know where the Lion came from or why
        he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon
        he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.<ref>C. S. Lewis. ''''On

        and the Wardrobe'''' was complete by the end of March 1949.\n\n===Name===\nThe
        name ''''Narnia'''' is based on [[Narni]], Italy, written in [[Latin]] as
        ''''Narnia''''. Lancelyn Green wrote: <blockquote>\nWhen Walter Hooper asked
        [C. S. Lewis] where he found the word ''Narnia'', Lewis showed him Murray''s
        Small Classical Atlas, ed. G.B. Grundy (1904), which he acquired when he was
        reading the classics with Mr Kirkpatrick at Great Bookham [1914\u20131917].
        On plate 8 of the Atlas is a map of ancient Italy. Lewis had underscored the
        name of a little town called Narnia, simply because he liked the sound of
        it. Narnia&nbsp;\u2014 or ''Narni'' in Italian&nbsp;\u2014 is in [[Umbria]],
        halfway between Rome and Assisi.<ref>Roger Lancelyn Green and Walter Hooper,

        edition of ''''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'''' was released in London
        on 16 October 1950. Although three more books, ''''Prince Caspian'''', ''''The
        Voyage of the Dawn Treader'''' and ''''The Horse and His Boy'''', were already
        complete, they were not released immediately at that time, but appeared (along
        with ''''The Silver Chair'''') one at a time in each of the subsequent years
        (1951\u20131954). The last two books (''''The Magician''s Nephew'''' and ''''The
        Last Battle'''') were published in the United Kingdom originally by [[The

        were first owned by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]],
        and later by [[HarperCollins]]. The two issued both hardcover and paperback
        editions of the series during their tenure as publishers, while at the same
        time [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic, Inc.]] produced paperback versions
        for sale primarily through direct mail order, book clubs, and book fairs.
        Harper Collins also published several one-volume collected editions containing
        the full text of the series. As noted below (see ''''''[[#Reading order|Reading
        Order]]''''''), the first American publisher, Macmillan, numbered the books
        in publication sequence, but when Harper Collins won the rights in 1994, at
        the suggestion of Lewis'' stepson they used the series'' internal chronological
        order. Scholastic switched the numbering of its paperback editions in 1994
        to mirror that of Harper Collins.<ref name=\"Ford\"/>{{rp|24}}\n\n==Books==\nThe

        help in his hour of need. Narnia, as they knew it, is no more, as more than

        retreated so far within themselves that only Aslan''s magic can wake them.

        Nephew'''' brings the reader back to the origins of Narnia where we learn
        how Aslan created the world and how evil first entered it. [[Digory Kirke]]
        and his friend [[Polly Plummer]] stumble into different worlds by experimenting
        with magic rings made by Digory''s uncle. They encounter [[White Witch|Jadis]]
        (The White Witch) in the dying world of Charn, and witness the creation of
        Narnia. Many long-standing questions about the world are answered as a result.
        The story is set in 1900, when Digory was a 12-year-old boy. He is a middle-aged

        of Narnia than their publication order and fall somewhat outside the main
        story arc connecting the others. The reading order of the other five books
        is not disputed.\n[[File:MacMillanNarnia.JPG|thumb|200px|A 1970 Collier-Macmillan

        first published, the books were not numbered. The first American publisher,
        Macmillan, enumerated them according to their original publication order,
        while some early British editions specified the internal chronological order.
        When Harper Collins took over the series rights in 1994, they adopted chronological
        order.<ref name=\"Ford\"/>{{rp|24}} To make the case for chronological order,
        Lewis'' stepson, [[Douglas Gresham]], quoted Lewis'' 1957 reply to a letter
        from an American fan who was having an argument with his mother about the
        order:\n\n<blockquote>\nI think I agree with your [chronological] order for
        reading the books more than with your mother''s. The series was not planned
        beforehand as she thinks. When I wrote ''''The Lion'''' I did not know I was
        going to write any more. Then I wrote ''''P. Caspian'''' as a sequel and still
        didn''t think there would be any more, and when I had done ''''The Voyage''''
        I felt quite sure it would be the last, but I found I was wrong. So perhaps
        it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them. I\u2019m not
        even sure that all the others were written in the same order in which they
        were published.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dorsett |first=Lyle |editor=Marjorie

        Collins adult editions of the books, the publisher cites this letter to assert
        Lewis'' preference for the numbering they adopted by including this notice
        on the copyright page:\n\n<blockquote>\nAlthough The Magician''s Nephew was
        written several years after C. S. Lewis first began The Chronicles of Narnia,
        he wanted it to be read as the first book in the series. Harper Collins is
        happy to present these books in the order in which Professor Lewis preferred.</blockquote>\n\nPaul

        and continues, \"most scholars disagree with this decision and find it the
        least faithful to Lewis''s deepest intentions\".<ref name=\"Ford\"/>{{rp|24}}
        Scholars and readers who appreciate the original order believe that Lewis
        was simply being gracious to his youthful correspondent and that he could

        the world is gradually presented in ''''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''''

        the reader. Moreover, they say, it is clear from the texts themselves that
        ''''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'''' was intended to be read first.
        When Aslan is first mentioned in ''''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'''',

        impact or effect as a flashback, told after later events which provide background
        and establish perspective. So it is [...] with the ''''Chronicles''''. The

        the Great Lion, is the [[eponymous]] lion of ''''The Lion, the Witch and the
        Wardrobe'''', and his role in Narnia is developed throughout the remaining
        books. He is also the only character to appear in all seven books. Aslan is
        a talking lion, the King of Beasts, son of the [[Emperor-Over-the-Sea]]. He
        is a wise, compassionate, magical authority (both temporal and spiritual)
        who serves as mysterious and benevolent guide to the human children who visit,
        as well as being the guardian and saviour of Narnia. C. S. Lewis described
        Aslan as an alternative version of Jesus as the form in which Christ might
        have appeared in an alternative reality.<ref>See Walter Hooper\u2019s ''''C.

        Pevensie|Susan Pevensie|Edmund Pevensie|Lucy Pevensie}}\nThe four Pevensie
        siblings are the main human protagonists of ''''The Chronicles of Narnia''''.
        Varying combinations of some or all of them appear in five of the seven novels.
        They are introduced in ''''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'''', and eventually
        become Kings and Queens of Narnia reigning as a tetrarchy: [[High King]] Peter
        the Magnificent, Queen Susan the Gentle, King Edmund the Just, and Queen Lucy
        the Valiant. Although introduced in the series as children, the siblings grow
        up into adults while reigning in Narnia. They go back to being children once
        they get back to their own world, but feature as adults in ''''The Horse and
        His Boy'''' during their Narnia reign.\n\nEchoing the Christian theme of betrayal,
        repentance, and subsequent redemption via blood sacrifice, Edmund betrays
        his siblings to Jadis, the White Witch, but quickly realises the true nature
        of the witch and her evil intentions towards his siblings, and joins Aslan''s
        side. At that point he is redeemed by the sacrifice of Aslan''s life and he
        joins the fight against the White Witch. Lucy is the youngest of the four
        Pevensie siblings. Of all the Pevensie children, Lucy is the closest to Aslan,
        and of all the human characters who visit Narnia, Lucy is perhaps the one
        who believes in Narnia the most.\n\nAll four appear in ''''The Lion, the Witch,
        and the Wardrobe'''' and ''''Prince Caspian''''; in the latter, however, Aslan
        tells Peter and Susan that they will not return, as they are getting too old.
        Susan, Lucy, and Edmund appear in ''''The Horse and His Boy'''' \u2013 Peter
        is said to be away fighting giants on the other side of Narnia. Lucy and Edmund
        appear in ''''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'''', where Aslan tells them,
        too, that they are getting too old. Peter, Edmund, and Lucy appear in ''''The
        Last Battle''''.\n\nSusan doesn''t appear in ''''The Last Battle'''' because
        by that time she has stopped believing in Narnia. Asked by a child in 1958
        if he would please write another book entitled \"Susan of Narnia\" so that
        the entire Pevensie family would be reunited, C. S. Lewis replied: \"I am
        so glad you like the Narnian books and it was nice of you to write and tell
        me. There''s no use just asking <u>me</u> to write more. When stories come
        into my mind I have to write them, and when they don''t I can''t!...\"*<ref>*Private

        Clarence Scrubb is a cousin of the Pevensies, and a classmate of Jill Pole
        at their school [[List of places in The Chronicles of Narnia#E|Experiment
        House]]. He is portrayed at first as a brat and a bully, but comes to improve
        his nasty behaviour when his greed turns him into a dragon for a while. His
        distress at having to live as a dragon causes him to reflect upon how horrible
        he has been, and he soon becomes a better person so Aslan changes him back
        into a boy. In the later books, Eustace comes across as a much nicer person,
        although he is still rather grumpy and argumentative. Nonetheless, he becomes
        a hero along with Jill Pole when the pair succeed in freeing the lost Prince
        Rilian from the clutches of an evil witch. He appears in ''''The Voyage of
        the Dawn Treader'''', ''''The Silver Chair'''', and ''''The Last Battle.''''\n\n===Jill

        Scrubb. She appears in ''''The Silver Chair'''', where she is the viewpoint
        character for most of the action, and returns in ''''The Last Battle''''.
        In ''''The Silver Chair'''' Eustace introduces her to the Narnian world, where
        Aslan gives her the task of memorising a series of signs that will help her
        and Eustace on their quest to find Caspian''s lost son. In ''''The Last Battle''''
        she and Eustace accompany King Tirian in his ill-fated defence of Narnia against
        the Calormenes.\n\n===Digory Kirke===\n{{Main|Digory Kirke}}\nDigory Kirke
        is the character referred to in the title of ''''The Magician''s Nephew''''.
        He first appears as a minor character in ''''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'''',
        but his true significance in the narrative is only revealed in ''''The Magician''s
        Nephew''''. He returns in ''''The Last Battle''''.\n\n===Polly Plummer===\n{{Main|Polly
        Plummer}}\nPolly Plummer appears in ''''The Magician''s Nephew'''' and ''''The
        Last Battle''''. She is the next-door neighbour of the young Digory Kirke.
        She is tricked by a wicked magician (who is Digory''s uncle) into touching
        a magic ring which transports her to the [[Wood between the Worlds]] and leaves
        her there stranded. The wicked uncle persuades Digory to follow her with a
        second magic ring that has the power to bring her back. This sets up the pair''s
        adventures into other worlds, and they witness the creation of Narnia as described
        in ''''The Magician''s Nephew''''.\n\n===Prince Caspian / Caspian X===\n{{Main|Caspian

        Paravel and Emperor of The Lone Islands \u2013 also called \"Caspian the Seafarer\"
        and \"Caspian the Navigator\" \u2014 is the title character of the second
        book in the series, first introduced as the young nephew and heir of King
        Miraz of Narnia. ''''Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia'''' is set 1300
        years after the rule of High King Peter and his siblings, when Old Narnians
        have been driven into hiding by Caspian''s ancestors the [[Telmar]]ines. Caspian
        is also a central character in ''''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'''', and
        appears briefly at the beginning and end of ''''The Silver Chair''''.\n\n===White
        Witch / Jadis===\n{{Main|White Witch}}\nJadis, commonly known during her rule
        of Narnia as the White Witch, is the main [[antagonist]] of ''''The Magician''s
        Nephew'''' and ''''The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe''''. She is the witch
        responsible for the freezing of Narnia resulting in the Hundred Year Winter.
        The White Witch was born in the world of Charn, before the creation of Narnia,
        and died in battle in Narnian year [[Narnian timeline|1000]].\n\n===Shasta
        / Cor===\n{{Main|Shasta (Narnia)}}\nShasta, later known as Cor of [[Archenland]],
        is the principal character in ''''The Horse and His Boy''''. Born the eldest
        son and heir of [[King Lune]] of Archenland, and elder twin of Prince Corin,
        Cor was kidnapped as an infant and raised as a fisherman''s son in the country
        of [[Calormen]]. Learning that he is about to be sold into slavery at the
        beginning of ''''The Horse and His Boy'''', Shasta escapes to freedom, saves
        Archenland and Narnia from invasion, learns of his true identity, and is restored
        to his heritage. Shasta grows up to become King of Archenland, marries the
        Calormene Tarkheena [[Aravis]], and fathers the next (and most famous) king
        of Archenland, Ram the Great.\n\n===Aravis===\n{{Main|Aravis}}\nAravis, daughter
        of Kidrash Tarkaan, is the secondary protagonist in ''''The Horse and His
        Boy''''. Escaping a forced betrothal to the loathsome Ahoshta, she joins Shasta
        on his journey and inadvertently overhears a plot by Rabadash, crown prince
        of Calormen, to invade Archenland. She later marries Shasta, now known as
        Prince Cor, and becomes queen of Archenland at his side.\n\n===Bree===\n{{Main|Bree
        (Narnia)}}\nBree (Breehy-hinny-brinny-hoohy-hah) is Shasta''s mount and mentor
        in ''''The Horse and His Boy''''. A Talking Horse of Narnia, he wandered into
        Calormen as a foal and was captured. He first appears as a Calormene nobleman''s
        war-horse; when the nobleman buys Shasta as a slave, Bree organises and carries
        out their joint escape. Though friendly, he is also vain and a braggart until
        his encounter with Aslan late in the story.\n\n===Trumpkin===\n{{Main|Trumpkin}}\nTrumpkin
        the Dwarf is the narrator of several chapters of ''''Prince Caspian''''; he
        is one of Caspian''s rescuers and a leading figure in the \"Old Narnian\"
        rebellion, and accompanies the Pevensie children from the ruins of Cair Paravel
        to the Old Narnian camp. In ''''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'''' we learn
        that Caspian has made him his Regent in Narnia while he is away at sea, and
        he appears briefly in this role (now elderly and very deaf) in ''''The Silver
        Chair''''.\n\n===Puddleglum===\n{{Main|Puddleglum}}\nPuddleglum the Marsh-wiggle
        guides Eustace and Jill on their quest in ''''The Silver Chair''''. Though
        always comically pessimistic, he provides the voice of reason and as such
        intervenes critically in the climactic enchantment scene.\n\n===King Tirian===\n{{Main|Tirian}}\nThe
        last King of Narnia is the viewpoint character for much of ''''The Last Battle''''.  Having
        rashly killed a Calormene for mistreating a Narnian Talking Horse, he is imprisoned

        TO EDITORS: This section is JUST A SUMMARY of the sections in the main article.
        All new material should be added to the Narnia (world) article.\n\n-->\n{{Main|Narnia
        (world)}}\n[[File:Narnian.world.map.jpg|400px|thumb|A map by David Bedell
        of the [[fictional universe]] of the Narnian world.]]\nThe main setting of
        ''''The Chronicles of Narnia'''' is the world of Narnia constructed by Lewis
        and, in ''''The Magician''s Nephew'''', the world containing the city of [[Charn]].
        The Narnian and Charnian worlds are themselves posited as just two in a [[Parallel
        universe (fiction)|multiverse]] of countless worlds that includes our own
        universe, the main protagonists'' world of origin. Passage between these worlds
        is possible, though rare, and may be accomplished by various means. Narnia
        itself is described as populated by a wide variety of creatures, most of which
        would be recognisable to those familiar with European mythologies and British
        fairy tales.\n\n===Inhabitants===\n:''''See also: [[List of Narnian creatures|Narnia
        creatures]] and [[List of The Chronicles of Narnia characters]]''''\n\nLewis''
        stories are populated with two distinct types of character: Humans originating
        from the reader''s world of Earth, and Narnian creatures and their descendants
        created by Aslan. This is typical of works that involve parallel universes.
        The majority of characters from the reader''s world serve as the protagonists
        of the various books, although some are only mentioned in passing depending
        on chronology. <!--HIDE THIS PENDING CLARIFICATION-Those inhabitants that
        Lewis creates through the character Aslan are viewed, either positively or
        negatively, as diverse.{{clarify|post-text=Diverse in what way?|date=March
        2011}}--> Lewis does not limit himself to a single source of inspiration;
        instead, he borrows from many sources,including ancient Greek and German mythology,
        as well as [[Celtic literature]]. <!--HIDE THIS UNTIL WE CAN GET A PROPER
        SOURCING-He also adds a few original creations of his own to the mix.{{Citation

        2011}}\n{{See also|List of places in The Chronicles of Narnia|l1=Narnian places}}\n\n''''The
        Chronicles of Narnia'''' describes the world in which Narnia exists as one
        major landmass encircled by an ocean.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Paul|title=Companion
        to Narnia: A Complete Guide to the Magical World of C.S. Lewis''s The Chronicles
        of Narnia|date=2005|publisher=Harper|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-06-079127-8|page=490|edition=Revised}}</ref>
        Narnia''s capital sits on the eastern edge of the landmass on the shores of
        the The Great Eastern Ocean.  This ocean contains the islands explored in
        ''''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader''''. On the main landmass Lewis places
        the countries of Narnia, Archenland, Calormen, and [[Telmar]], along with
        a variety of other areas that are not described as countries. The author also
        provides glimpses of more fantastic locations that exist in and around the
        main world of Narnia, including an edge and an underworld.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Paul|title=Companion
        to Narnia: A Complete Guide to the Magical World of C.S. Lewis''s The Chronicles
        of Narnia|date=2005|publisher=Harper|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-06-079127-8|page=491|edition=Revised}}</ref>\n\nThere
        are several maps of the Narnian universe available, including what many consider
        the \"official\" one, a full-colour version published in 1972 by the books''
        illustrator, Pauline Baynes. This is currently out of print, although smaller
        copies can be found in the most recent HarperCollins 2006 hardcover edition
        of ''''The Chronicles of Narnia''''. Two other maps were produced as a result
        of the popularity of the 2005 film ''''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion,
        the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''''. One, the \"Rose Map of Narnia\", is based
        loosely on Baynes'' map and has Narnian trivia printed on the reverse. The
        other, made in a monochromatic, archaic style reminiscent of maps of Tolkien''s
        [[Middle-earth]], is available in print and in an interactive version on the
        DVD of the movie. The latter map depicts only the country Narnia and not the
        rest of Lewis'' world.\n\n===Cosmology===\nA recurring plot device in ''''The
        Chronicles'''' is the interaction between the various worlds that make up
        the Narnian multiverse. A variety of methods are used to initiate these cross-overs
        which generally serve to introduce characters to the land of Narnia. The Cosmology
        of Narnia is not as internally consistent as that of Lewis'' contemporary
        Tolkien''s Middle-earth, but suffices given the more fairy tale atmosphere
        of the work. During the course of the series we learn in passing, that the
        world of Narnia is flat and [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] and has different
        stars from those of Earth, and that the passage of time does not correspond
        directly to the passage of time in our world.\n\n===History===\n:See also:
        ''''[[Narnian timeline]]'''' and ''''[[Narnia (world)#History|History of Narnia]]''''\n\n''''The
        Chronicles'''' cover the entire history of the world of Narnia, describing
        the process by which it was created, offering snapshots of life in Narnia
        as its history unfolds, and how it is ultimately destroyed. As is often the
        case in a children''s series, children themselves, usually from our world,
        play a prominent role in all of these events. The history of Narnia is generally
        divided into the following periods: creation and the period shortly afterwards,
        the rule of the White Witch, the Golden Age, the invasion and rule of the
        Telmarines, their subsequent defeat by Caspian X, the rule of King Caspian
        and his descendants, and the destruction of Narnia. Like many stories, the
        narrative is not necessarily always presented in chronological order.\n\n==Influences==\n\n===Lewis''
        life===\nLewis'' early life has parallels with ''''The Chronicles of Narnia''''.
        At the age of seven, he moved with his family to a large house on the edge
        of [[Belfast]]. Its long hallways and empty rooms inspired Lewis and his brother
        to invent make-believe worlds whilst exploring their home, an activity reflected
        in Lucy''s discovery of Narnia in ''''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''''.<ref>{{cite

        |year=1990 |isbn=0-00-623815-7 |page=14 }}</ref>  Like Caspian and Rilian,
        Lewis lost his mother at an early age, spending much of his youth in English
        boarding schools similar to those attended by the Pevensie children, Eustace
        Scrubb, and Jill Pole. During World War II many children were evacuated from
        London and other urban areas because of German air raids. Some of these children,
        including one named Lucy (Lewis'' goddaughter) stayed with him at his home
        The Kilns near Oxford, just as the Pevensies stayed with [[Digory Kirke|The
        Professor]] in ''''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''''.<ref>{{cite web

        of the Center for Christian Study, noted that the producers of the film ''''[[The
        Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]'''' felt that
        the books'' plots adhere to the archetypal \"[[monomyth]]\" pattern as detailed

        was widely read in [[British literature#Early Celtic literature|medieval Celtic
        literature]], an influence reflected throughout the books, and most strongly
        in ''''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.'''' The entire book imitates one of
        the [[immram]]a, a type of traditional [[Old Irish]] tale that combines elements
        of Christianity and [[Irish mythology]] to tell the story of a hero''s sea
        journey to the [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Huttar|first=Charles

        March 2011}}</ref><ref>Duriez, pp80, 95</ref> Medieval Ireland also had a
        tradition of High Kings ruling over lesser kings and queens or princes, as
        in Narnia. Lewis'' term \"Cair,\" as in [[Cair Paravel]], also mirrors \"Caer\",
        or \"fortress\" in the Welsh language. [[Reepicheep]]''s small boat is a ''''[[coracle]]'''',
        a type of vessel traditionally used in the [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] regions
        of the British Isles.  Some creatures in the book such as the one-footed [[Monopod
        (creature)|Dufflepuds]] reflect elements of Greek, Roman and Medieval mythology
        while other Narnian creatures are borrowed from Greek and Germanic mythology:
        for example, [[centaurs]] from the former and [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]]
        from the latter.\n\nIn 2008 [[Michael Ward (scholar)|Michael Ward]] published
        ''''Planet Narnia'''',<ref>Michael Ward, ''''Planet Narnia: The Seven Heavens
        in the Imagination of C. S. Lewis'''' (Oxford University Press, 2008)</ref>
        which proposed that each of the seven books related to one of the [[Classical
        planet|seven moving heavenly bodies or \"planets\"]] known in the Middle Ages
        according to the [[Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic geocentric model]] of [[cosmology]]
        (a theme to which Lewis returned habitually throughout his work). At that
        time, each of these heavenly bodies was believed to have certain attributes,
        and Ward contends that these attributes were deliberately but subtly used
        by Lewis to furnish elements of the stories of each book:\n<blockquote>In
        ''''The Lion'''' [the child protagonists] become monarchs under sovereign
        [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]]; in ''''Prince Caspian'''' they harden under
        strong [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]; in ''''The \"Dawn Treader\"'''' they drink
        light under searching [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]]; in ''''The Silver Chair''''
        they learn obedience under subordinate [[Luna (mythology)|Luna]]; in ''''The
        Horse and His Boy'''' they come to love poetry under eloquent [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]];
        in ''''The Magician''s Nephew'''' they gain life-giving fruit under fertile
        [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]; and in ''''The Last Battle'''' they suffer and
        die under chilling [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]].\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Michael|title=Planet
        Narnia|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-531387-1|page=237}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSimilarly,
        Lewis'' interest in the literary symbolism of medieval and Renaissance astrology
        is more overtly referenced in other works such as his study of medieval cosmology
        ''''[[The Discarded Image]]'''', in his early poetry  as well as in ''''[[The
        Space Trilogy|Space Trilogy]]''''. Narnia scholar [[Paul F. Ford]] finds Ward''s
        assertion that Lewis intended ''''The Chronicles'''' to be an embodiment of
        medieval astrology implausible,<ref name=\"Ford\"/>{{rp|16}} though Ford addresses
        an earlier (2003) version of Ward''s thesis (also called ''''Planet Narnia'''',
        published in the ''''Times Literary Supplement'''').  Ford argues that Lewis
        did not start with a coherent plan for the books, but Ward''s book answers
        this by arguing that the astrological associations grew in the writing.{{Citation
        needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nGeorge MacDonald''s \"[[Phantastes]]\" (1858) influenced
        the structure and setting of \"The Chronicles\". It was a work that was \"

        Narnia'''' has been a significant influence on both adult and children''s
        fantasy literature in the post-World War II era.  Examples include:\n\n[[Philip
        Pullman]]''s acclaimed fantasy series ''''[[His Dark Materials]]'''' is seen
        as a response to ''''The Chronicles''''. Pullman is a self-described [[atheist]]
        who wholly rejects the spiritual themes that permeate ''''The Chronicles'''',
        yet his series nonetheless addresses many of the same issues and introduces
        some similar character types, including talking animals. In another parallel,
        the first books in each series \u2013 Pullman''s ''''[[Northern Lights (novel)|Northern
        Lights]]'''' and ''''The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'''' \u2013 both

        horror novella ''''[[Coraline]]'''' has been compared to ''''The Lion, the
        Witch, and the Wardrobe'''', as both books involve young girls travelling
        to magical worlds through doors in their new houses and fighting evil with
        the help of talking animals. His ''''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]]''''
        comic book series also features a Narnia-like \"dream island\" in its story
        arc entitled ''''[[A Game of You]]''''.\n\nThe novel ''''[[Bridge to Terabithia
        (novel)|Bridge to Terabithia]]'''' by [[Katherine Paterson]] has Leslie, one
        of the main characters, reveal to her co-protagonist Jesse her love of Lewis''
        books, subsequently lending him ''''The Chronicles of Narnia'''' so that he
        can learn how to behave like a king. Her book also features the island name
        \"Terabithia\", which sounds similar to [[Terebinthia]], a Narnian island
        that appears in ''''Prince Caspian'''' and ''''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader''''.
        Katherine Paterson herself acknowledges that Terabithia is likely to be derived
        from Terebinthia:\n<blockquote>I thought I had made it up. Then, rereading
        ''''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'''' by C. S. Lewis, I realized that I had
        probably gotten it from the island of Terebinthia in that book. However, Lewis
        probably got that name from the [[Pistacia palaestina|Terebinth]] tree in
        the Bible, so both of us pinched from somewhere else, probably unconsciously.\"<ref>''''Bridge

        short story \"Oracle\" depicts a parallel universe in which an author nicknamed
        Jack (Lewis'' nickname) has written novels about the fictional \"Kingdom of
        Nesica\", and whose wife is dying of cancer, paralleling the death of Lewis''
        wife [[Joy Davidman]]. Several Narnian allegories are also used to explore

        ''''[[The Magicians (Grossman novel)|The Magicians]]'''' is a contemporary
        dark fantasy about an unusually gifted young man obsessed with Fillory, the
        magical land of his favourite childhood books. Fillory is a thinly veiled
        substitute for Narnia, and clearly the author expects it to be experienced
        as such. Not only is the land home to many similar talking animals and mythical
        creatures, it is also accessed through a grandfather clock in the home of
        an uncle to whom five English children are sent during World War II.  Moreover,
        the land is ruled by two Aslan-like rams named Ember and Umber, and terrorised
        by The Watcherwoman. She, like the White Witch, freezes the land in time.
        The book''s plot revolves heavily around a place very like the \"wood between
        the worlds\" from ''''The Magician''s Nephew'''', an interworld waystation
        in which pools of water lead to other lands. This reference to ''''The Magician''s
        Nephew'''' is echoed in the title of the book.<ref>Publishers Weekly blog

        between Narnia and her world: \"Narnia is literally a different world\", she

        you can see if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions

        in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child. I got so caught

        have been criticised (often by other authors of fantasy fiction) for [[gender
        role]] stereotyping, though other authors have defended Lewis in this area.
        For example, Lucy gets a healing potion and a dagger, while Peter gets a sword.
        Most allegations of [[sexism]] centre on the description of Susan Pevensie
        in ''''The Last Battle'''' when Lewis writes that Susan is \"no longer a friend
        of Narnia\" and interested \"in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstick
        and invitations\".\n\n[[J.K. Rowling]] has said:\n<blockquote>There comes
        a point where Susan, who was the older girl, is lost to Narnia because she

        like women in general, or [[human sexuality|sexuality]] at all, at least at

        issues of sexuality and violence and through it Gaiman presents a critique
        of Lewis'' treatment of Susan.<ref name=\"WagnerGolden2008\"/>\n\nOther writers,
        including fan-magazine editor [[Andrew Rilstone]], oppose this view, arguing
        that the \"lipsticks, nylons and invitations\" quote is taken out of context.
        They maintain that in ''''The Last Battle'''', Susan is excluded from Narnia
        explicitly because she no longer believes in it. At the end of ''''The Last
        Battle'''' Susan is still alive with her ultimate fate unspecified. Moreover,
        in ''''The Horse and His Boy'''', Susan''s adulthood and sexual maturity are
        portrayed in a positive light, and therefore argued to be unlikely reasons
        for her exclusion from Narnia.\n\nLewis supporters also cite the positive
        roles of women in the series, including Jill Pole in ''''The Silver Chair'''',
        Aravis Tarkheena in ''''The Horse and His Boy'''', Polly Plummer in ''''The
        Magician''s Nephew,'''' and particularly Lucy Pevensie in ''''The Lion, the
        Witch and the Wardrobe''''. Alan Jacobs, an English professor at Wheaton College,
        asserts that Lucy is the most admirable of the human characters and that generally
        the girls come off better than the boys throughout the series (Jacobs, 2008:
        259).<ref>\"[http://www.livejournal.com/users/synaesthete7/176635.html The

        animated films. Many of the characters'' voices in the British TV release
        were re-recorded by British actors and actresses with the exception of the
        characters Aslan, Peter, Susan, and Lucy.\n\nBetween 1988 and 1990, the first
        four books (as published) were adapted by the BBC as [[The Chronicles of Narnia
        (TV serial)|four television serials]]. They were also aired in America on
        the PBS/Disney show [[WonderWorks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieretriever.com/videohound_lists/90154/Wonderworks-Family-Movie-Series|title=Wonderworks

        a total of 14 Emmy awards, including \"Outstanding Children''s Program\",
        and a number of [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] awards including Best
        Children''s Programme (Entertainment / Drama) in 1988, 1989 and 1990.<ref>{{cite

        films (the second of which combined ''''Prince Caspian'''' and ''''The Voyage
        of the Dawn Treader'''' into one) and released on VHS and DVD.\n\n===Radio===\nA
        critically acclaimed [[BBC Radio 4]] dramatisation was produced in the 1980s,
        starring [[Maurice Denham]] as Professor Kirke. Collectively titled ''''Tales
        of Narnia'''', the  programs covered the entire series with a running time
        of approximately 15 hours.  In Great Britain, BBC Audiobooks release both
        audio cassette and compact disc versions of the series.\n\nBetween 1999 and
        2002 Focus on the Family produced radio dramatisations of the entire series
        through its [[Focus on the Family''s Radio Theatre|Radio Theatre]] program.<ref>{{cite

        Scofield]] as \"The Storyteller\" and [[David Suchet]] as Aslan.  Accompanied
        by an original orchestral score and cinema-quality [[Digital audio|digital
        sound]] design, the series was hosted by Lewis'' stepson Douglas Gresham and
        ran for just over 22 hours. Recordings of the entire adaptation were released
        on compact disc between 1999\u20132003.\n\n===Stage===\nMany stage adaptations
        of ''''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'''' have been produced over the
        years.\n\nIn 1984, Vanessa Ford Productions presented ''''The Lion, the Witch
        and the Wardrobe'''' at London''s Westminster Theatre. Adapted by Glyn Robbins,
        the play was directed by Richard Williams and designed by Marty Flood. The
        production was later revived at Westminster and The Royalty Theatre and went
        on tour until 1997. Productions of other tales from ''''The Chronicles''''
        were also staged, including ''''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'''' (1986),
        ''''The Magician''s Nephew'''' (1988) and ''''The Horse and His Boy'''' (1990).\n\nIn
        1997, Trumpets Inc., a Filipino Christian theatre and musical production company,
        produced a musical rendition of \"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\" that
        Douglas Gresham, Lewis'' stepson (and co-producer of the Walden Media film
        adaptations), has openly declared that he feels is the closest to Lewis''
        intent. The book and lyrics were written by Jaime del Mundo and Luna Inocian,
        while the music was composed by Lito Villareal.<ref>{{cite web \n |url= http://www.philstar.com/sunday-life/2012/10/14/859279/stepson-narnia\n

        that any cinematic adaptation could render the more fantastical elements and
        characters of the story realistically, Lewis never sold the film rights to
        the ''''Narnia'''' series.<ref>A general dislike of cinema can be seen in
        ''''Collected Letters'''', Vol. 2, a letter to his brother Warren on 3 March
        1940, p. 361; see also ''''All My Road Before Me'''', 1 June 1926, p. 405</ref>
        In answering a letter with a question posed by a child in 1957, asking if
        the Narnia series could please be on television, C. S. Lewis wrote back: \"They''d
        be no good on TV. Humanized beasts can''t be presented to the ''''eye''''
        without at once becoming either hideous or ridiculous. I wish the idiots who
        run the film world [would] realize that there are stories [which] are for
        the ''''ear'''' alone.\"<ref>Patricia Baird, private collection</ref> Only
        after seeing a demo reel of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animals did
        Douglas Gresham, Lewis''s stepson and [[literary executor]], and the films''
        co-producer, give approval for a film adaptation.\n\nThe first novel adapted
        was ''''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'''' as ''''[[The Chronicles of
        Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'''' released in December 2005.
        Produced by [[Walden Media]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]],
        the film was directed by [[Andrew Adamson]], with a screenplay by Ann Peacock,
        Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus. The movie was a critical and box-office
        success, grossing over $745 million worldwide and {{as of|lc=y|2011|03}} ranked
        38th on the [[list of highest-grossing films]] in nominal terms. Disney and
        Walden Media then co-produced a sequel ''''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince
        Caspian]]'''', released in May 2008, which grossed over $419 million worldwide.\n\nIn
        December 2008 Disney pulled out of financing the remainder of the ''''Chronicles
        of Narnia'''' film series.<ref>{{cite web|last = Sanford|first = James|title
