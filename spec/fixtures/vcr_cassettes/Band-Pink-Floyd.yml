        were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in London. They achieved international
        acclaim with their [[progressive rock|progressive]] and [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]]
        music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation,
        extended compositions and elaborate [[Pink Floyd live performances|live shows]],
        they are one of the most [[List of best-selling music artists|commercially
        successful]] and influential groups in the history of popular music.\n\nPink
        Floyd were founded in 1965 by students [[Syd Barrett]] on guitar, [[Nick Mason]]
        on drums, [[Roger Waters]] on bass, and [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard
        Wright]] on keyboards. They gained popularity performing in London''s underground
        music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett''s leadership released
        two charting singles and a successful debut album, ''''[[The Piper at the
        Gates of Dawn]]'''' (1967). Guitarist [[David Gilmour]] joined in December
        1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating [[mental health]]. Waters
        became the band''s primary lyricist and eventually their dominant songwriter,
        devising the [[concept album|concepts]] behind their albums ''''[[The Dark
        Side of the Moon]]'''' (1973), ''''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish
        You Were Here]]'''' (1975), ''''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]''''
        (1977), ''''[[The Wall]]'''' (1979) and ''''[[The Final Cut (album)|The Final
        Cut]]'''' (1983). ''''The Dark Side of the Moon'''' and ''''The Wall'''' became
        two of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]].\n\nFollowing
        creative tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985.
        Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd; Wright rejoined them as a session
        musician and, later, a band member. The three produced two more albums, ''''[[A
        Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'''' (1987) and ''''[[The Division Bell]]'''' (1994),
        and toured until 1994. After nearly two decades of acrimony, Pink Floyd reunited
        with Waters in 2005 for a performance at the global awareness event [[Live
        8]], but Gilmour and Waters have since stated they have no plans to reunite
        as a band again. Barrett died in 2006 and Wright in 2008. The final Pink Floyd
        studio album, ''''[[The Endless River]],'''' recorded without Waters and based
        on songs recorded in 1993\u20131994, was released in November 2014.\n\nPink
        Floyd were inducted into the US [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996, and
        the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2005. By 2013, the band had sold more than
        250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the
        United States.\n\n== 1963\u201367: early years ==\n\n=== Formation ===\n\n[[Roger

        student Ken Chapman.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=38\u201339}}\n\nIn September 1963,
        Waters and Mason moved into a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens near [[Crouch End]]
        in London, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the nearby [[Hornsey

        and watched him play guitar at Barrett''s mother''s house.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=22\u201323}}
        Mason said about Barrett: \"In a period when everyone was being cool in a
        very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring
        memory of our first encounter is the fact that he bothered to come up and
        introduce himself to me.\"{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=27}}\n\nNoble and Metcalfe left
        the Tea Set in late 1963, and Klose introduced the band to singer Chris Dennis,
        a technician with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=42\u201344}}
        In December 1964, they secured their first recording time, at a studio in
        West Hampstead, through one of Wright''s friends, who let them use some down
        time free. Wright, who was taking a break from his studies, did not participate
        in the session.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=29\u201330}}{{refn|group=nb|The four-song

        theme\".{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=29\u201330}}}} When the RAF assigned Dennis a
        post in Bahrain in early 1965, Barrett became the band''s frontman.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=19}}{{refn|group=nb|According
        to Povey, by 1964 the group began calling itself the Abdabs.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=14}}}}
        Later that year, they became the resident band at the Countdown Club near
        [[Kensington High Street]] in London, where from late night until early morning
        they played three sets of 90 minutes each. During this period, spurred by
        the group''s need to extend their sets in order to minimise song repetition,
        the band realised that \"songs could be extended with lengthy solos\", wrote
        Mason.{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=30}} After pressure from his parents and advice from
        his college tutors, Klose quit the band in mid-1965 and Barrett took over
        lead guitar.<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=44\u201345}}: Klose quit the band

        the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=18\u201319}}

        Club]] in March 1966, where [[Peter Jenner]], a lecturer at the [[London School
        of Economics]], noticed them. Jenner was impressed by the sonic effects Barrett
        and Wright created, and with his business partner and friend [[Andrew King

        shorter two-part \"[[Pigs on the Wing]]\".{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=242\u2013245}}

        Floyd \u2013 The Wall}}\nIn July 1978, amid a financial crisis  caused by
        negligent investments, Waters presented the group with two original ideas
        for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title
        ''''Bricks in the Wall'''', and the other would later become Waters'' first
        solo album, ''''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]''''. Although both Mason
        and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next
        album.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=258\u2013259}}{{refn|group=nb|In 1976, Pink Floyd
        had become involved with financial advisers Norton Warburg Group (NWG). NWG
        became the band''s collecting agents and handled all financial planning, for
        an annual fee of about \u00a3300,000. NWG invested between \u00a31.6&nbsp;million
        and \u00a33.3&nbsp;million of the band''s money in high-risk venture capital
        schemes, primarily to reduce their exposure to UK taxes. It soon became apparent
        that the band were still losing money. Not only did NWG invest in failing
        businesses, they also left the band liable for tax bills as high as 83 per
        cent of their income. The band eventually terminated their relationship with
        NWG and demanded the return of any funds not yet invested, which at that time
        amounted to \u00a3860,000; they received only \u00a3740,000.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=206\u2013208}}
        Pink Floyd eventually sued NWG for \u00a31M, accusing them of fraud and negligence.
        NWG collapsed in 1981: Andrew Warburg fled to Spain; Waterbrook purchased
        Norton Warburg Investments, and many of its holdings sold at a significant
        loss. Andrew Warburg began serving a three-year jail sentence upon his return

        which was the death of his father in World War II. This first metaphorical
        brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by
        the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development
        inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the
        increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once

        originally conceived as the soundtrack album for ''''Pink Floyd \u2013 The

        and began writing new material. He saw [[Margaret Thatcher]]''s response to
        the invasion of the Falklands as [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] and unnecessary,
        and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between

        upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice.
        Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to assist
        them. As Pink Floyd toured throughout North America, Waters'' ''''[[Radio

        than those hosting his former band''s performances. Waters issued a writ for
        copyright fees for the band''s use of the [[Pink Floyd pigs|flying pig]].
        Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside
        to distinguish it from Waters'' design.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=277}} The parties
        reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right

        to, among other things, ''''The Wall''''.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=329\u2013335}}\n\n===

        In January 1993, they began working on a new album, returning to Britannia
        Row Studios, where for several days, Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively,
        improvising material. After about two weeks, the band had enough ideas to
        begin creating songs. Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production

        a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, \"pulled the whole

        Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day the latter
        agreed. Gilmour then contacted Wright who immediately agreed. In their statement

        the day\".{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=31}} Despite sounding what Mason considered \"too
        ''''radical'''' for the general viewer\", they earned a callback for a second

        they did not earn an appearance on the show.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=31\u201332}}
        Also in 1965, they auditioned for the ''''[[Melody Maker]]'''' Beat Contest,

        According to ''''Rolling Stone'''': \"By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably
        psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched
        on [[hard rock]], blues, [[country music|country]], [[folk music|folk]], and
        [[electronic music]].\"{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=761}} Released in 1968,
        the song \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\" helped galvanise their reputation
        as an [[art rock]] group.{{sfn|di Perna|2002|p=13}} Critics also describe
        them as an [[acid rock]] band.{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=760}} By the late
        1960s, the press had begun to label their music [[progressive rock]].{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=85}}
        O''Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd:\n\n<blockquote>\nRarely
        will you find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play,
        or predictable three-chord blues progressions; and never will you find them
        spending much time on the usual pop pablum of romance, partying, or self-hype.
        Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging&nbsp;... Where
        most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort
        of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd
        tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a
        life of its own&nbsp;... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals
        which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and
        integral parts of the performance.{{sfn|O''Neill Surber|2007|pp=192\u2013199}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn
        1968, Wright commented on Pink Floyd''s sonic reputation: \"It''s hard to
        see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group. We never saw
        ourselves that way&nbsp;... we realised that we were, after all, only playing
        for fun&nbsp;... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever
        we wanted&nbsp;... the emphasis&nbsp;... [is] firmly on spontaneity and improvisation.\"{{sfn|Fitch|2001|p=45}}
        Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band''s early sound: \"There
        wasn''t anything ''grand'' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We
        couldn''t play at all so we had to do something stupid and ''experimental''...&nbsp;Syd
        was a genius, but I wouldn''t want to go back to playing \"[[Interstellar
        Overdrive]]\" for hours and hours.\"{{sfn|Hibbert|1996|p=147}} Unconstrained
        by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock
        during the 1970s and [[ambient music]] during the 1980s.{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|pp=760\u2013761}}\n\n===

        fingers make a distinctive sound&nbsp;... [they] aren''t very fast, but I
        think I am instantly recognisable&nbsp;... The way I play melodies is connected
        to things like [[Hank Marvin]] and [[the Shadows]]\".{{sfn|di Perna|2006|pp=58\u201359}}
        Gilmour''s ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without
        sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to [[jazz]] trumpeter
        [[Miles Davis]].{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=62}}\n\nIn 2006, ''''Guitar World'''' writer
        Jimmy Brown described Gilmour''s guitar style as \"characterised by simple,
        huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures.\"{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=62}}
        According to Brown, Gilmour''s solos on \"Money\", \"[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]\"
        and \"[[Comfortably Numb]]\" \"cut through the mix like a laser beam through
        fog.\"{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=62}} Brown described the \"Time\" solo as \"a masterpiece
        of phrasing and motivic development&nbsp;... Gilmour paces himself throughout
        and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching
        one-and-one-half-step ''over bends'', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically
        impeccable bar vibrato.\"{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=66}} Brown described Gilmour''s
        sense of phrasing as intuitive, singling it out as perhaps his best asset
        as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone:
        \"I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting&nbsp;... [to get]
        singing sustain&nbsp;... you need to play loud \u2014 at or near the feedback
        threshold. It''s just so much more fun to play&nbsp;... when bent notes slice
        right through you like a razor blade.\"{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=62}}\n\n=== Sonic
        experimentation ===\nThroughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with
        their sound. Their second single, \"See Emily Play\" premiered at the [[Queen
        Elizabeth Hall]] in London, on 12 May 1967. During the performance, the group
        first used an early [[Quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic device]] called an [[Azimuth
        Co-ordinator]].{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=86}} The device enabled the controller,
        usually Wright, to manipulate the band''s amplified sound, combined with recorded
        tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic
        swirling effect.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=134}} In 1972, they purchased a custom-built
        PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=178}}\n\nWaters
        experimented with the [[EMS Synthi A]] and [[EMS VCS 3|VCS 3]] synthesisers
        on Pink Floyd pieces such as \"[[On the Run (instrumental)|On the Run]]\",
        \"[[Welcome to the Machine]]\", and \"[[In the Flesh?]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=169}}:
        Synthesiser use in \"On the Run\"; {{harvnb|Fitch|2005|p=324}}: Synthesiser

        on his bass-guitar track for \"[[One of These Days (instrumental)|One of These
        Days]]\".{{sfn|Mabbett|1995|p=39}}\n\nPink Floyd used innovative sound effects
        and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of ''''The
        Final Cut''''. Mason''s contributions to the album were almost entirely limited
        to work with the experimental [[Holophonics|Holophonic]] system, an audio
        processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system
        used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the
        sound around the listener''s head when they were wearing headphones. The process
        enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside
        the listener''s ears.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=297\u2013298}}\n\n=== Film scores
        ===\nPink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with
        ''''[[The Committee (film)|The Committee]]''''.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=133\u2013135}}
        In 1969, they recorded the score for [[Barbet Schroeder]]''s film ''''[[More
        (1969 film)|More]]''''. The soundtrack proved beneficial; not only did it
        pay well but, along with ''''A Saucerful of Secrets'''', the material they
        created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=128}}
        While composing the soundtrack for director [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]''s
        film ''''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'''', the band stayed at
        a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month. Waters claimed that, without Antonioni''s
        constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less
        than a week. Eventually he used only three of their recordings. One of the
        pieces turned down by Antonioni, called \"The Violent Sequence\", later became
        \"Us and Them\", included on 1973''s ''''The Dark Side of the Moon''''.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=135\u2013136}}
        In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film ''''La Vall\u00e9e'''',
        for which they released a soundtrack album called ''''[[Obscured by Clouds]]''''.
        They composed the material in about a week at the [[Ch\u00e2teau d''H\u00e9rouville]]
        near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd''s first album to break
        into the top&nbsp;50 on the US Billboard chart.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\n===

        they headlined an all-night event called ''''[[The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream]]''''
        at the [[Alexandra Palace]], London. Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at
        around three o''clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry

        by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television
        coverage of the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing, performing an instrumental piece
        which they called \"[[Moonhead (song)|Moonhead]]\".{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=87:

        November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen
        that would become a staple of their live shows.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=183}} In
        1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named \"Algie\".
        Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience,
        would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|p=241}}
        The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of
        the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album ''''[[The Wall]]''''.
        The subsequent [[The Wall Tour]] featured a {{convert|40|ft|m}} high wall,
        built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience.
        They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to
        view various scenes from the story. They commissioned the creation of several
        giant inflatables to represent characters from the story.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=280\u2013282}}
        One striking feature of the tour was the performance of \"Comfortably Numb\".
        While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue
        on top of the wall. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly
        reveal him. Gilmour stood on a [[flightcase]] on castors, an insecure setup
        supported from behind by a technician. A large hydraulic platform supported
        both Gilmour and the tech.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=284\u2013285}}\n\nDuring the
        [[The Division Bell Tour|Division Bell Tour]], an unknown person using the
        name [[Publius Enigma|Publius]] posted a message on an internet newsgroup
        inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. White
        lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in [[East Rutherford,
        New Jersey|East Rutherford]] spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During
        a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the
        word \"enigma\" in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later
        acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery,

        are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes \"Pink\"
        is the name of one of the band members.{{sfn|Detmer|2007|p=77}} According
        to author David Detmer, the album''s lyrics deal with the \"dehumanizing aspects
        of the world of commerce\", a situation the artist must endure in order to
        reach their audience.{{sfn|Detmer|2007|p=75}}\n\nAbsence as a lyrical theme
        is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett
        after 1968, and that of Waters'' father, who died during the [[Second World
        War]]. Waters'' lyrics also explored unrealized political goals and unsuccessful
        endeavors. Their film score, ''''Obscured by Clouds'''', dealt with the loss
        of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with aging.{{sfn|O''Neill Surber|2007|p=197}}
        Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the
        lyrics of ''''Wish You Were Here'''': \"The idea of presence withheld, of
        the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere,
        and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress
        the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme,
        absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Thorgerson|first=Storm|year=1978|title=The

        design for ''''Wish You Were Here''''{{''s}} cover included four sides, counting
        the inner jacket, which represented four absences related to the classical
        [[Classical element|categories of substance]]: earth, air, fire and water.
        His ''''Dark Side'''' album cover features a beam of white light, representing
        unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted
        beam of coloured light symbolizes unity diffracted, leaving an absence of
        unity.{{sfn|Weinstein|2007|p=86}} Absence is a key element in the existentialism
        of [[Albert Camus]], who defined absurdity as the absence of a response to
        the individual''s need for unity.{{sfn|Weinstein|2007|p=86}}}} Waters commented:
        \"it''s about none of us really being there&nbsp;... [it] should have been
        called ''''Wish We Were Here''''\".{{sfn|Weinstein|2007|p=90}}\n\nO''Neill
        Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of [[Being
        and Nothingness#Nothingness|non-being]] a common theme in their music.{{sfn|O''Neill
        Surber|2007|p=192}}{{refn|group=nb|Philosophy originated from the Greek poet,
        [[Parmenides]], who wrote a poem in which the protagonist takes a cosmic chariot
        ride guided by a goddess who shows him that there are only two paths in life,
        being, which leads to truth, and non-being, which leads to confusion and discontent.
        The goddess also told Parmenides: \"thought and being are one\".{{sfn|O''Neill
        Surber|2007|p=191}}}} Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in ''''The
        Wall'''', with the lyrics to \"Comfortably Numb\": \"I caught a fleeting glimpse,
        out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put
        my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone.\"{{sfn|O''Neill
        Surber|2007|p=197}} Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution
        to the band''s catalogue, \"Jugband Blues\": \"I''m most obliged to you for
        making it clear that I''m not here.\"{{sfn|O''Neill Surber|2007|p=197}}\n\n===
        Exploitation and oppression ===\n\nAuthor Patrick Croskery described ''''Animals''''
        as a unique blend of the \"powerful sounds and suggestive themes\" of ''''Dark
        Side'''' with ''''The Wall''''{{''s}} portrayal of artistic alienation.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=35}}
        He drew a parallel between the album''s political themes and that of Orwell''s
        ''''Animal Farm''''.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=35}} ''''Animals'''' begins with
        a thought experiment, which asks: \"If you didn''t care what happened to me.
        And I didn''t care for you\", then develops a [[beast fable]] based on anthropomorphized
        characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each. The
        lyrics ultimately paint a picture of [[dystopia]], the inevitable result of
        a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in
        the opening lines.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nThe album''s characters
        include the \"Dogs\", representing fervent capitalists, the \"Pigs\", symbolizing
        political corruption, and the \"Sheep\", who represent the exploited.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|pp=37\u201340}}
        Croskery described the \"Sheep\" as being in a \"state of delusion created
        by a misleading cultural identity\", a [[false consciousness]].{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=40}}
        The \"Dog\", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up
        depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction
        after a life of exploitation.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|pp=37\u201338}} Waters used
        [[Mary Whitehouse]] as an example of a \"Pig\"; being someone who in his estimation,
        used the power of the government to impose her values on society.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=39}}
        At the album''s conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement:
        \"You know that I care what happens to you. And I know that you care for me
        too.\"{{sfn|Croskery|2007|p=41}} However, he also acknowledges that the \"Pigs\"
        are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a \"Dog\" who requires shelter,
        suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus
        an ongoing battle between them.{{sfn|Croskery|2007|pp=41\u201342}}\n\n===

        The lyrics to ''''Wish You Were Here''''{{''s}} \"Welcome to the Machine\"
        suggest what Marx called the [[Marx''s theory of alienation|alienation of

        to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others.{{sfn|O''Neill
        Surber|2007|p=195}} Allusions to the [[Marx''s theory of alienation#Types
        of alienation|alienation of man''s species being]] can be found in ''''Animals'''';
        the \"Dog\" reduced to living instinctively as a non-human.{{sfn|O''Neill
        Surber|2007|p=196}} The \"Dogs\" become alienated from themselves to the extent
        that they justify their lack of integrity as a \"necessary and defensible\"
        position in \"a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle\"
        wrote Detmer.{{sfn|Detmer|2007|p=73}} [[Marx''s theory of alienation#Types
        of alienation|Alienation from others]] is a consistent theme in the lyrics
        of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of ''''The Wall''''.{{sfn|O''Neill
        Surber|2007|p=195}}\n\nWar, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation
        of alienation from others, is also a core element of ''''The Wall'''', and
        a recurring theme in the band''s music.{{sfn|O''Neill Surber|2007|pp=195\u2013196}}
        Waters'' father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics
        often alluded to the cost of war, including those from \"Corporal Clegg\"
        (1968), \"[[Free Four]]\" (1972), \"[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]\" (1973),
        \"[[When the Tigers Broke Free]]\" and \"[[The Fletcher Memorial Home]]\"

        the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=194\u2013195}}
        He viewed the album''s explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal
        condition.{{sfn|Weinstein|2007|p=85}} However, Waters also wanted the album
        to communicate positivity, calling it \"an exhortation&nbsp;... to embrace
        the positive and reject the negative.\"{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=81}} Reisch described
        ''''The Wall'''' as \"less about the experience of madness than the habits,
        institutions, and social structures that ''''create'''' or ''''cause'''' madness.\"{{sfn|Reisch|2007|p=257}}
        ''''The Wall''''{{''s}} protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances
        of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off
        from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making. After he completes
        his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is \"crazy, over the
        rainbow\".{{sfn|Reisch|2007|p=263}} He then considers the possibility that
        his condition may be his own fault: \"have I been guilty all this time?\"{{sfn|Reisch|2007|p=263}}
        Realizing his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down,
        his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly
        criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him.
        He then stands trial for \"showing feelings of an almost human nature\", further
        exacerbating his alienation of species being.{{sfn|Reisch|2007|pp=263\u2013264}}
        As with the writings of philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], Waters'' lyrics suggest
        Pink''s insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, \"custom,
        codependancies, and psychopathologies\", contribute to his angst, according
        to Reisch.{{sfn|Reisch|2007|pp=258\u2013264}}\n\n== Recognition and influence
